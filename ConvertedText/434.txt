Help:Captcha - Meta Help:Captcha From Meta, a Wikimedia project coordination wiki This is an archived version of this page, as edited by Atcovi (talk | contribs) at 20:46, 16 May 2019.

(diff) Jump to navigation Jump to search Websites that accept postings from the public, like this wiki, are often abused by spammers who use automated tools to post their links to many sites. While these spam links can be removed, they are a significant nuisance. Sometimes, especially when adding new web links to a page, the wiki may show you an image of colored or distorted text and asks you to type the words shown. Since this is a task that's hard to automate, it will allow most real humans to make their posts while stopping most spammers and other robotic attackers. Unfortunately this may inconvenience users with limited vision or using text-based or speech-based browsers. At the moment we do not have an audio alternative available. Please contact the site administrators for assistance if this is unexpectedly preventing you from making legitimate actions. Hit the "back" button in your browser to return to the page editor.
