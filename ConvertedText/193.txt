Guide to WikiProjects Directory of WikiProjects Shortcut WP:NUMIS Numismatics (ancient Greek: ?????????????) is the scientific study of money and its history in all its varied forms. While numismatists are often characterized as studying coins, the discipline also includes the study of banknotes (notaphily), stock certificates (scripophily), medals, medallions, and token coins (also referred to as exonumia).
