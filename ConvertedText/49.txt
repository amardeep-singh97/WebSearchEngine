New participants are welcome; please feel free to participate! Guide to WikiProjects Directory of WikiProjects Shortcut WP:CATP WikiProject Categories has been set up to help manage the categories of Wikipedia and improve them. The goal is to categorize all articles in a way that is consistent with the guidelines at Wikipedia:Categorization. Discussions about categorization policy happen at Wikipedia talk:Categorization. That page is also the place for solving specific issues related to category organization. To discuss deleting, merging, or renaming categories, see Wikipedia:Categories for discussion. Please direct all talk to Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Categories if you would like to help or comment on the project. There is a task force that puts uncategorized articles into categories.
