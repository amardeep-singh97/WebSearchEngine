My journey as an editor began when I registered an account on the English Wikipedia on July 11, 2007. My interest in music led me to join the project and my edits have largely focused on articles regarding musicians, groups and bands, albums, songs, discographies, and other areas related to entertainment. I became a local administrator following my successful request for adminship on November 2, 2009. Historically, I have utilized my administrative tools in fields where I regularly frequented with great interest, such as those dealing with media files and categories. Irrespective of those areas, my participation across the site has allowed to acquire expertise in numerous venues across the platform. Over on Wikimedia Commons, I became an administrator on January 9, 2019. The "ethnic cleansing" problem In particular, the English Wikipedia has an "ethnic cleansing" problem. Subjects from countries where English is not the native or official language and utilize a non-Latin script alphabet are especially susceptible. When citing references, English-language sources are not required, but a lack thereof is enough of a shortcoming for an article to be marked for deletion. Sources in the topic's native language are often ignored, even in cases where knowledgeable users provide them; falling under the scrutiny of the eyes of the wrong group of users can easily lead to the systematic removal of invaluable articles. Actively trying to save these articles is a daunting task to undertake, but the effort on those who commit to handle this issue to the best of their ability is desperately needed. My photography In 2018, I decided to pick up a new hobby: photography. Originally from the United States, I figured I could offer the community some content unique to my life experiences in South Korea. My craft has taken me across the country as I honed my skills while capturing musicians and actors in timeless works of art. Below, a glimpse of my world.
