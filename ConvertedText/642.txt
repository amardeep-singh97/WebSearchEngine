Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/Archives - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/Archives From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Wikipedia:Wikipedia SignpostRedirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/Archives/Years This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed) or is the result of a page move. One reason this page was kept as a redirect is to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name. Any redirect with a page move logged on its history page should be tagged with this rcat template. To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space. From a subpage: This is a redirect from a subpage. In a page title, a subpage name appears after a forward slash (/); for example, "Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket/Articles", which is a subpage of "Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket", redirects to Template:CricketRecentChanges. Not all articles or other pages with "/" in their titles are subpages (e.g. CP/M). If this redirect is in mainspace, then it will populate the Redirects with old history category bold-linked above; if in any other namespace, then Category:Redirects from subpages will be populated. To a subpage: This is a redirect to a subpage. In a page title, a subpage name appears after a forward slash (/); for example, "Wikipedia:Technical move requests" redirects to Wikipedia:Requested moves/Technical requests, which is a subpage of Wikipedia:Requested moves. Please note that not every page title with "/" in its title is a subpage. See this template's documentation for details. From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace. Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
