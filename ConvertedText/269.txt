AGF[edit] See Wikipedia:Assume good faith. At Did You Know, AGF means to assume that a referenced fact is actually in the reference, even though you haven't read the reference. This is acceptable if the reference is offline, or if the reference is in a foreign language, or if you have to pay for a subscription before you can read it. ALT, ALT1, ALT2 etc.[edit] means an alternate hook for the same article. It could be a slight rewording of the same idea, or a completely different hook. ALTs are suggested at the suggestion page after the original hook. Often an ALT is selected instead of the original version. approval[edit] A nomination needs approval, with a or before it can proceed to a preparation area. See WP:Did you know/Approval. April Fools' Day[edit] is observed at Did You Know. See Wikipedia:April Fool's Main Page/Did You Know, and if you aren't familiar with Western culture see April Fools' Day. archives[edit] at Did You Know means Wikipedia:Recent additions, where old Did You Know hooks are stored indefinitely after they have been on the Main Page. article[edit] At Did You Know, "article" means the article being introduced on the Main Page by a hook. For instance, if the hook is "... that Jon Olav Alstad was elected to the Norwegian Parliament at the age of 25?", then it introduces the article Jon Olav Alstad (not Norwegian Parliament, which isn't in bold print). Rules for the article are here. bare URL[edit] is like http://example.com with the URL visible to Wikipedia's readers. copyvio[edit] See Wikipedia:Copyright violations. If there was no previous article except for a copyvio, then replacing it with a non-copyvio article is considered a new article, and it doesn't have to be expanded fivefold. characters[edit] A character is a letter, or a space between letters, or a punctuation mark, or anything else made with one keystroke (or one shifted keystroke). The next sentence is an example of how to count characters. This sentence has 32 characters. Count 4 for the four letters in "This", 1 for the space between "This" and "sentence", 8 for the 8 letters in "sentence", 1 for the space after "sentence", 3 for "has", 1 for the next space, 2 for the "3" and the "2" in "32", 1 for the space, 10 for "characters", and 1 for the period. 4 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 32. There are occasional debates on whether Wikipedia should count article size using "characters" or "bytes". Better terminology for that debate would be whether to use prose or the article's history page, which counts the whole article. For ordinary text, one character occupies one byte, and only one byte, so the character count and the byte count are the same. credits[edit] at Did You Know means bot-generated messages on nominators' user talk pages, thanking them for contributing after the nominations have made it to the Main Page. Did You Know[edit] See the Did You Know section of the Main Page for the visible, short explanation. The system that produces that section is also called Did You Know, and the writeup this glossary belongs to explains it in detail. double-DYK[edit] is a hook that introduces two articles. DYK[edit] See Did You Know. DYKADMINBOT[edit] Has been replaced by DYKUpdateBot. Historical: WP:DYKADMINBOT. DYKcheck[edit] is a script that checks nominations for errors. See WP:Did you know/DYKcheck and User:Shubinator/DYKcheck. DYKproblem[edit] is a template used to tell a nominator that he needs to deal with a problem or question on his nomination. See Template:DYKproblem. DYKsug[edit] has been replaced with NewDYKnom. See {{DYKsug}}. DYKUpdateBot[edit] (needs link) expansion[edit] at Did You Know means to expand an existing article, that is, to add text and make it longer, hopefully expanding it enough to make it qualify as a new article. fair use[edit] See Wikipedia:Fair use fivefold[edit] means five times. For instance, if an article has 1000 bytes of prose (not the whole article, see the "prose" entry), it must be expanded to 5000 bytes of prose (not the whole article) to be considered new, and thus eligible for Did You Know. good article[edit] A good article (GA) is one that has been reviewed via the good article nomination process and been listed as a GA. New GAs are considered to be eligible for Did You Know; it is as if they were newly created on the day they became a good article, so they must be nominated as quickly as a newly created or newly expanded article. good faith[edit] See AGF. hook[edit] An example of a hook is "... that Jon Olav Alstad was elected to the Norwegian Parliament at the age of 25?" The Did You Know section on the Main Page contains about eight hooks, usually starting with "... that" and ending with "?". They are called "hooks" because they are intended to hook the reader into reading the associated article. Rules for the hook are here. IGF[edit] In Good Faith. See AGF. image[edit] is a picture. See Wikipedia:Image inline citation[edit] See Wikipedia:Inline citation negative[edit] At Did You Know, "negative" means criticism in a hook, as in the Wikipedia:Biography of Living Persons policy. NewDYKnom[edit] is a template used to format a nomination. See {{NewDYKnom}}. nominate[edit] To suggest or propose. At Did You Know, "nominate" means to suggest a hook and its associated article. "Nomination" can mean the hook, the article, or both. offline[edit] at Did You Know means a reference that you can't get online, that is, on the Internet, usually because the source is a book or similar library resource. preparation areas[edit] are Template:Did you know/Preparation area 1, Template:Did you know/Preparation area 2, Template:Did you know/Preparation area 3, Template:Did you know/Preparation area 4, Template:Did you know/Preparation area 5, and Template:Did you know/Preparation area 6. Approved hooks are moved from T:TDYK to a preparation area and organized into a group of usually about eight. From there, an administrator will eventually move each preparation area page into one of the queues, after which DYKADMINBOT will move it to the Main Page. See "update". prose[edit] At Did You Know, only characters of "prose" are counted when measuring the length of an article, whether it's to meet the 1,500 character minimum, or to calculate whether an article has been expanded fivefold. Characters of prose are counted by the User:Shubinator/DYKcheck script, which excludes infoboxes, categories, references, lists, tables, block quotes, headers, images and captions, the "See also" section if any, Table of Contents, edit buttons, "citation needed" and similar superscripted text, and reference link numbers like [6]. Prosesizebytes.js[edit] is a script that measures the characters in the prose portion of the article. See User talk:Dr pda/prosesizebytes.js. DYKcheck is now preferred to prosesizebytes. Prosesize.js[edit] is an older form of #Prosesizebytes.js. DYKcheck is now preferred to prosesize.js and to prosesizebytes.js. queue[edit] is what Americans call a "line", as in "line up and wait your turn". At Did You Know, it means Template:Did you know/Queue, where Did You Know pages wait for their twelve-hour turn to go onto the Main Page. There is room for six updates in the queue. reliable[edit] means Wikipedia:Reliable sources. The word is often used in a way that sounds as if we are loosely calling people liars, but all it really means is that a source is on the list of what we consider to be reliable enough. run-on[edit] is described at run-on sentence. It does NOT mean a rambling sentence that runs on and on! If you don't understand the grammatical distinction in the run-on sentence article, then please do not use the term "run-on". self-nom[edit] is a nomination of a hook and an article you wrote yourself. This is permitted and encouraged. T:TDYK[edit] is both the shortcut to Template talk:Did you know (the DYK suggestions page) and a shorthand way of referring to it. template[edit] See Wikipedia:Template namespace text[edit] See prose. twofer[edit] Two articles introduced in the same hook. update[edit] A single set of approximately eight hooks to be displayed on the Main Page for about twelve hours. Each update is individually prepared in a preparation area and moved into the queues by an administrator, then onto the Main Page by DYKADMINBOT. user subpage[edit] See Wikipedia:User subpage. You may write your article on a user subpage, so you will have time to study the Did You Know process before your article is disqualified for being too old. The seven days (and the exception) don't start until you move the article into Wikipedia:main namespace. verify[edit] See approval. x[edit] as in 5x or 1.3x, is a way of expressing how nearly an article has reached fivefold expansion. From 2000 bytes of prose to 3000 bytes is a 1.5x expansion. It would have to be expanded to 10,000 bytes of prose (not the whole article, just prose) to be 5x and qualify as new.
