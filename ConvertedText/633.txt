Whether you celebrate your hemisphere's Solstice or Christmas, Diwali, Hogmanay, Hanukkah, Lenaia, Festivus or even the Saturnalia, this is a special time of year for almost everyone! Spread the holiday cheer by adding {{subst:User:WereSpielChequers/Dec20}} to your friends' talk pages. Making it easier to search the pages within a category.[edit] Re https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitors&oldid=1029813923 do you think I'm right about something like that being a good idea to be included/transcluded onto category pages? Much like the "External tools" links are included on page history pages? The syntax is little documented - e.g. no mention of it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Category#Searching_for_pages_in_categories.

Upon taking a second look, I can see where that would be a useful tool, especially for heavily-populated categories. I will look for a suitable policy page where I can request community input. In the meantime, I will be happy to self-revert for the time being. Thanks! PohranicniStraze (talk) 18:21, 22 June 2021 (UTC) I've added a request for comment, including your comment from here, at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Categories, in case you'd like to comment further there. Thanks, and happy editing! PohranicniStraze (talk) 18:42, 22 June 2021 (UTC) Appreciate you!--50.201.195.170 (talk) 22:58, 29 June 2021 (UTC) Category talk:Dudley???Winthrop family[edit] Hello, PohranicniStraze, I saw that you tagged this page for deletion. There are often talk pages without articles because new editors, especially IP editors, can not create articles so they use the talk page as a place to write on. There is even a nightly report, Wikipedia:Database reports/Orphaned talk pages, that lists talk pages without accompanying articles. You can always tag them CSD G8 "Talk page of a nonexistent or deleted page". Thanks! Liz Read!

The ??tienne de Perier article was blown up with an edit war recently, and I've been working on a full rewrite, using the Talk page to get consensus before fixing the article directly. It could benefit from having some more voices in the discussion. Everything's been rewritten and updated on the main article, except for the sections covering his time as governor. That section is in progress at Talk:??tienne de Perier/Temp. ???Carter (talk) 19:33, 29 June 2021 (UTC) Disambiguation link notification for June 30[edit] An automated process has detected that when you recently edited Robert Dixon (clergyman), you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page Tunstall.
