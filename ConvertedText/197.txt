Category:Redirects to sections - Wikipedia Help Category:Redirects to sections From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The pages in this category are redirects to sections of articles or other pages. To add a redirect to this category, place {{Rcat shell|{{R to section}}}} on the second new line (skip a line) after #REDIRECT [[Target page name]]. For more information follow the links. Never substitute redirect template(s), nor place them on soft redirects. See also the complete list of redirect templates and the redirect style guide. This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance ??? show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). Redirects to sections are usually created to be used as shortcuts, or when there is not enough information to write a whole article, project page, etc., about a subtopic or related topic, but there is enough information to include a section about it in another article or page. The latter type redirects are good search terms and may have the possibility of becoming full articles someday.
