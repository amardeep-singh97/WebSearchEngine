Wikipedia:Resolving disputes - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Resolving disputes From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Wikipedia:Dispute resolution This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed) or is the result of a page move. One reason this page was kept as a redirect is to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name. Any redirect with a page move logged on its history page should be tagged with this rcat template. To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space. From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace. Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
