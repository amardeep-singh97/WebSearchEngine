Wikipedia:Double redirect - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Double redirect From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Wikipedia:Double redirects Note: If you reached this redirect page by clicking the link in the project page, Wikipedia:Double redirects (note the plural as opposed to the singular redirect title above), this is how a double redirect works, which does not take readers to the page they wanted. So the double redirect, which may be linked near the top of this page and titled "Wikipedia:Example of a double redirect", would normally have to be "fixed". Fixing them is easy; see How to fix a double redirect. This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: From a modification: This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title or a closely related title. For example, the words may be rearranged. Please note that there are many more specific templates. Please use {{R from alternative spelling}} for spelling changes (including punctuation and spacing); see subcategories of Category:Redirects from modifications for other options (capitals, abbreviations, diacritics, plurals, stylizations, transliteration, ligatures, different parts of speech, etc.). If you are unsure which to use, this template is fine; someone will make it more specific later if necessary. In cases of modification from distinctly longer or shorter names, please use {{R from long name}} or {{R from short name}}, respectively. An abbreviation should be tagged with {{R from initialism}} or, if it can be spoken like a word such as NASA and RADAR, use {{R from acronym}}. Use this rcat instead of {{R from other capitalisation}} and {{R from plural}} in namespaces other than mainspace for those types of modification. This may also apply to several other subcategories of modification; please check those templates' output before saving if using outside of mainspace. To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space. Used for convenience: This is a redirect from a title that is intended to make it easier to get to the target page; the target is a more appropriate page for the purpose of the redirected title. This rcat is reserved for redirects that target talk pages to centralize discussion and redirects that may not fit other descriptions. For example, this may be a redirect from a title that is used colloquially; however, it is not currently an officially accepted term, though it may have been in the past. It leads to the title in accordance with the naming conventions for common names and can help writing and searches. This redirect does not need to be replaced with a piped link. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
