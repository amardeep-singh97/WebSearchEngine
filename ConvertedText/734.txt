Error while opening a page containing a equals sign ("=") when Visual Editor installed One comment • 08:47, 12 July 2021 2 minutes ago 1 Edit title History Permalink Summarize Totina (talkcontribs) Hello there, after successfully upgrading my MediaWiki installation from version 1.31 to 1.35.3 I installed Visual Editor 0.1.2 (b73df7e) as a last step. The editor works perfectly fine (I was happy to see that installation is really easy now!). The strange thing is: Once VE is installed and activated, I'm getting an error message (see below) every time I try to open a page (for reading) that contains an equals sign ("="). Since this sign occurs in all the headlines, almost all my content pages are affected. If I open the same page for editing (VE or not), everything is fine. If I open a page without any "=" in the text, the error is gone. If I disable Visual Editor in LocalSettings.php and open any page (with or without "="), the error is totally gone. I also tried to switch to the VE version coming with the official MW 1.35.3 tarball - same error, same situation. I tried different skins as well (all VE compatible) - same error, same situation. I also tried to change the language to EN (DE is my default) but it made no difference. And I certainly ran the update script with every change. What could I possibly do to avoid the error? Any help is very much appreciated! Thanks and greetings!

'/i18n'; return; } else { die( 'This version of the LanguageSelector extension requires MediaWiki 1.35+' ); } The language selector dropdown shows all the languages instead of just English and Spanish. Any idea of what is likely to be the problem?

It is a local server only, no idea why the states about the internet connection also. The error is "error loading data from server, Make sure you have a working internet connection and try again" Is there a way I can check my connection to my database during the specific action? or way to find the logs why it keeps hanging after I access the specific page?
