Wikipedia:Requested articles - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Requested articles From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wiki project page (common for all projects) "WP:RA" redirects here. You may have been looking for Wikipedia:Recent additions, Wikipedia:WikiProject Requested articles, Wikipedia:Role accounts, or Wikipedia:Requests for adminship. "WP:SUGGEST" redirects here. You may be looking for User:SuggestBot. "WP:REQ" redirects here. You may have been looking for Wikipedia:Requests, a general directory of Wikipedia request pages, or Wikipedia:WikiProject Resource Exchange/Resource Request for requesting copies of articles in paywalled publications. How to request an article 1. First, check that the article you're looking for doesn't already exist: Search Wikipedia (or use a search engine) for existing articles. If an article exists, but not at the title you expected, you can create a redirect. Check your spelling. Articles generally use the most common name for the subject. This may not be the official name, scientific name, or another name you have in mind. 2. Next, be sure the article is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. Articles must be about notable topics: those that have received significant coverage in independent, reliable sources. We have a fairly precise definition of what is considered a "reliable source", as well as detailed inclusion guidelines. 3. Next, search the existing article requests to make sure your subject is not already listed: 4. Now choose an appropriate general topic area below, choose the best sub-topic that fits your subject, and use that link to go to its page. Add your request there by clicking "edit" at the appropriate heading. Give a brief description, with links if possible, for the proposed topic, to aid others in understanding your request. I want to write an article myself If you have written an article, you can submit it for creation. Be aware that there are guidelines about what is an acceptable subject for an article, as mentioned above. For editors Please help by fulfilling these requests! Help maintain the list by moving misplaced or unsorted requests to the appropriate section. Many requests can be fulfilled by creating a redirect from the requested title. Fulfilled requests should be removed from the list. Remember to categorize newly created articles, and tag them as stubs if they are short. More tasks available at WikiProject Requested Articles.

Wikipedia:Requests for expansion/Archive, Category:Articles to be expanded and Category:Stubs lists very short preliminary articles that have not yet been developed. Category:Redirects with possibilities lists many redirects with good potential to become future articles.
