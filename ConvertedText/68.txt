Category:Redirects with possibilities - Wikipedia Help Category:Redirects with possibilities From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search "WP:RWP" redirects here. For Wikipedia's own radio show, see Wikipedia:Radio Wikipedia. For advice about real-world perspective, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction) § Real-world perspective. The pages in this category are redirects from subtopics of their targets that have the possibility to become separate articles. To add a redirect to this category, place {{Rcat shell|{{R with possibilities}}}} on the second new line (skip a line) after #REDIRECT [[Target page name]]. For more information follow the links. Never substitute redirect template(s), nor place them on soft redirects. See also the complete list of redirect templates and the redirect style guide. This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance ??? show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). Shortcut CAT:RWP This category contains redirects that potentially could be changed into articles, project pages, etc. Do not place a redirect in this category directly ??? instead, add {{R with possibilities}} to the redirect. If the redirect is a template, then it will automatically populate Category:Template redirects with possibilities instead of this category. For category redirect pages, do not use this template, but add {{R category with possibilities}} instead. Articles should link to these redirects (except for category redirects). Do not retarget links to these redirects directly to the article to which they redirect. Treat these as pages that will be articles someday. For further information, see WP:SPINOUT and WP:NOTBROKEN and Template:Redirect with possibilities. Contents: Top 0???9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z * # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ???
