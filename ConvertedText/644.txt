Peaceray (talk) 05:52, 12 June 2021 (UTC) I'd love to become a member of the Signpost team![edit] Hey there! I've always been an avid reader of the Signpost. Recently, I've noticed that the Signpost has somewhat slowed down, and I'd like to join the team! I'm not sure of the meaning of TBD (does that mean candidates for this role are being selected from a list? what's the difference between TBD and vacant?), but if it's possible, I'd love to become a publication manager for the Signpost. Later, I may decide to take on whatever's on my mind in terms of article creation here, but I'm focusing on one thing at a time right now. Thanks! ???? EpicPupper (he/him | talk, FAQ, contribs) 03:43, 15 June 2021 (UTC) Careful! One benign expression of interest in taking on a small role can lead the modern equivalent of The ed17 to sign you up to be EIC! But seriously, always wonderful for the Signpost to have new contributors! I'm no longer involved, but I believe Smallbones' latest note from the editor signaled he would be stepping back, so there's plenty of room for people to step up, I'd think.

It might be helpful to include 2-3 paragraphs on what you think you can do best on The Signpost, what role do you think we can play within the community, *any* journalism experience you have. There are no right answers of course - just to see better where you would best fit in. Thanks.

I am not sure if I ever shared this here, I have been sitting on it for a while. If anyone has feedback on this version then share with me, and I might do another version. I thought to make this because people ask what the newspaper is and how they can support, and I wanted to have some kind of promotion to help.
