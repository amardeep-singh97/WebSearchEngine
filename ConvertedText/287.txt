Please update this Wikipedia page to reflect recent events or newly available information. (August 2016) E1: Either write out your nomination naturally, or optionally, format your nomination using {{subst:NewDYKnomination}}. E2: Add it to the suggestions page under "Articles created/expanded on [date]", where the date is when the article was created or when the expansion started. If the date is over seven days old and you can't find it, sorry, it isn't considered a new article. E3: Note that you should only use one of the above templates for the original hook. If you want to suggest a second, alternative hook for the same article submission, just type it in manually. The above templates output useful code for each submission and if you employ them for alternative hooks, you will mess up the page formatting. E4: When saving your suggestion, please add the name of the suggested article to your edit summary. E5: If you nominate someone else's article, you can use {{subst:DYKNom}} to notify them. Usage: {{subst:DYKNom|Article name|July 12}} Thanks, ~~~~ Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Did_you_know/Submission&oldid=1031750074" Categories: Wikipedia Did you know rules Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Project page Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Donate Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Download as PDF Printable version Languages Add links This page was last edited on 3 July 2021, at 12:05 (UTC).
