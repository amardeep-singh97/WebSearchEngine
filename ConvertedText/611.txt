Template:R from alternative spelling - Wikipedia Template:R from alternative spelling From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search When used with the "Redirect category shell" (Rcat shell) template: This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: From a different spelling: This is a redirect from a title with a different spelling of the target name. Pages that link to this redirect may be updated to link directly to the target page if that results in an improvement of the text. Do not "fix" such links if they are not broken. Also, these links should not be replaced with piped links. Please note that there are many more specific templates. See subcategories of Category:Redirects from modifications for other options (capitals, abbreviations, diacritics, plurals, stylizations, transliteration, ligatures, different parts of speech, etc.) At present, {{R from alternative hyphenation}}, {{R from alternative punctuation}}, and {{R from alternative spacing}} all redirect to this template and feed into the same maintenance category. This is likely to change in the future, so please use the more specific template names. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized. Template {{Redirect category shell}} may be used to add one or more rcat templates, along with their parameters and categories, to a redirect. For more information see the documentation page below. When used by itself: From a different spelling: This is a redirect from a title with a different spelling of the target name.

 Template {{Rcat shell}} is an alias for the Redirect category shell template, which may be used to add as many appropriate rcats as needed, usually from one to seven, along with their parameters, to a redirect. For more information see the documentation on its template page. This rcat may also tag a redirect individually: #REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{R from alternative spelling}}
 This is in accord with instructions found at Wikipedia:REDCAT. Use this rcat to tag any redirect in any namespace from a title with a different correct spelling of the target. Do not use this rcat to tag a redirect from an incorrectly spelled title ??? misspelled redirects should be tagged with {{R from misspelling}} instead ??? such "typo" redirects are frequently good search terms. Pages that link to these redirects may be updated to link directly to the target pages if that results in an improvement of the text. Do not "fix" such links if they are not broken. In addition, these links should not be replaced with piped links. Parameters One of two parameters, either |1= or |of=, may be used to alter the text when the other spelling is of a name that is different from the target's title. They are used as follows: {{Rcat shell|
{{R from alternative spelling|1=(other spelling)}}
}}
 or the 1= may be omitted: {{Rcat shell|
{{R from alternative spelling|(other spelling)}}
}}
 and when the |of= parameter is used: {{Rcat shell|
{{R from alternative spelling|of=(other spelling)}}
}}
 The text will be changed from ...a different spelling of the target name to ...a different spelling of (other spelling). TemplateData This redirect category (rcat) template populates the category 'Redirects from alternative spellings' Template parameters Parameter Description Type Status other spelling 1 of For spellings that are different from redirect target's String optional Aliases Also known as... ??? list of templates that redirect here and may also be used If it is a redirect from an excessively anglicized name to a more authentic one, please use: {{R from anglicization}} (a template redirect with possibilities). If, on the other hand, it is anglicization by removal of diacritics, then instead use the separate rcat template: {{R to diacritics}}. Printworthiness Please do not alter the printworthy settings of this rcat without first notifying the Version 1.0 Editorial Team, who are responsible for any and all materials, including redirects, that go into a printed version of Wikipedia. In main-article namespace, many redirects from other spellings of target titles are considered printworthy; however, there are many others that are unprintworthy, so there is no default sort for printworthiness. In 2003, efforts were begun to support the Wikimedia Foundation's goal of increasing access and availability of Wikipedia articles in printed versions. Some rcats automatically populate either Category:Printworthy redirects or Category:Unprintworthy redirects by default. Others, like this rcat, do not, and that means it is up to editors to choose which of those categories, Printworthy or Unprintworthy, is appropriate and should be populated. The rcats that are used separately to populate those categories are: {{R printworthy}} and {{R unprintworthy}} Please click on each one for more details and guidance. Template {{Redirect category shell}} will accept these rcats just like any other. Examples: {{Rcat shell|
{{R from alternative spelling}}
{{R printworthy}}
}}

{{Rcat shell|
{{R from alternative spelling}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
