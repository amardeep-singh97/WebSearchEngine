They are found in the Special: namespace, a virtual namespace whose pages lack corresponding talk pages. They are not written in wikitext and can't be edited in the normal way; but elements of their pages can sometimes be edited through corresponding pages in the MediaWiki namespace. If you make a normal redirect to a special page, the redirect will not be immediately followed (though special pages can be targets of soft redirects), and creating any pages beginning with the Special: prefix is also not possible. Special pages often take parameters. Sometimes these can be supplied after a slash (as in Special:Log/block); in other cases an index.php call is used; for example https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&days=3&limit=10. Also, the content of most special pages depends on preferences that have been set by the user, e.g. classic or enhanced Recent Changes, the number of titles in Recent Changes and the watchlist, etc. A directory of special pages can be accessed from Special:SpecialPages, which is found in the sidebar of every page on Wikipedia in the Tools section.

To find the right portion of text, append ?uselang=qqx to the special page URL, and append &uselang=qqx instead if the URL already contains a ?, This will reveal message names in parentheses. Then, go to that name in the MediaWiki namespace. For example, Special:BookSources?uselang=qqx reveals "(booksources-summary)", so MediaWiki:booksources-summary is used on that page. To propose a modification, leave an {{edit protected}} request on the talk page of the relevant MediaWiki page. An administrator will make the change if it seems appropriate. Available special pages General information Special:SpecialPages: a list of most special pages currently available to all users.

Special:Random). When non-existent pages are linked or transcluded, a red link is produced (e.g., Special:Red link example). More information on transcludable special pages can be found at Wikipedia:Transclusion#Special pages. Links containing URL query strings Main page: Help:Link § Links containing URL query strings Because the ampersand character (&) is disallowed, it is not possible to create an ordinary link containing &action=edit or &redirect=no in the URL query string. Special pages in other languages The term in the site language equivalent to English "Special" is used in each project, for example: "Especial" in Spanish "Spécial" in French "Speciaal" in Dutch "Spezial" in German These also appear in the URLs.
