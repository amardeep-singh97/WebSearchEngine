MOS:TM - Wikipedia MOS:TM From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trademarks This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space. To a subpage: This is a redirect to a subpage. In a page title, a subpage name appears after a forward slash (/); for example, "Wikipedia:Technical move requests" redirects to Wikipedia:Requested moves/Technical requests, which is a subpage of Wikipedia:Requested moves. Please note that not every page title with "/" in its title is a subpage. See this template's documentation for details. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
