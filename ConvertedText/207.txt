Wikipedia:Maintenance - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Maintenance From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia project page Shortcuts WP:MAINT WP:WM Wikipedia maintenance Task Center open tasks Backlog Dashboard Database reports Special pages new pages Category tracker WikiProjects resources Maintenance work is a vital part of keeping Wikipedia running optimally. Most of these tasks can be done by any user. Below are administrative pages used for the maintenance of the English Wikipedia project, including; cleanup pages, maintenance reports, to???do lists, information pages, and related collaboration groups. For a list of jobs and tasks to be completed that is easy to understand, there is the Task Center. Maintenance tasks of the most pressing importance can be found at the Backlog page. (See open???tasks and backlog below.) New to Wikipedia? See the contributing to Wikipedia page for everything you need to know to get started.

Particular care should be observed when adding information about living persons to any Wikipedia page. Wikipedia should not be used as platform for activism, recruitment, promotion, advertising, announcements, or other forms of advocacy. Copyright violations Main page: Wikipedia:Copyright problems Editors interested in identifying and resolving copyright violations may enjoy CopyPatrol, a tool from Community Tech. Handling of suspected violations of copyright policy depends on the particulars of a given case. If you suspect a copyright violation but are uncertain if the content is copyrighted or whether the external site is copying from Wikipedia, you should at least bring up the issue on that page's discussion page, if it is active. In that case, please tag the page {{copypaste|url=insert URL here, if known}}, unless your concerns are swiftly resolved. Others can then examine the situation and take action if needed. The most helpful piece of information you can provide is a URL or other reference to what you believe may be the source of the text. You may also make a note of your concerns at Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems. If you have strong reason to suspect a violation of copyright policy and some, but not all, of the content of a page appears to be a copyright infringement, then the infringing content should be removed, and a note to that effect should be made on the discussion page, along with the original source, if known. {{subst:Cclean|url=insert URL or description of source here (optional)}} has been created for this. See Wikipedia:WikiProject Copyright Cleanup for details. Vandalism Main page: Wikipedia:Cleaning up vandalism Upon discovering vandalism, revert such edits, using the undo function or an anti-vandalism tool. Once the vandalism is undone, you should warn the vandalizing editor. Notify administrators at the vandalism noticeboard of editors who continue to vandalize despite warnings, and administrators should intervene to preserve content and prevent further disruption by blocking such editors. Users whose main or sole purpose is clearly vandalism may be blocked indefinitely without warning. See Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism Unit and Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol To make vandalism reverts easier you can ask for the rollback feature to be enabled for your registered Wikipedia account. This feature is only for reverting vandalism and other obvious disruption, and lets you revert several recent edits with a single click. See Wikipedia:Requests for permissions. New pages Main page: Wikipedia:New pages patrol Identify new articles which do not meet the criteria for inclusion and/or to tag them for any glaring issues that need attention. Most critical are copyright violations and defamatory material about living persons, followed closely by pages whose creators seek to exploit our voluntary work for financial gain. Reviewing new pages needs a thorough knowledge of deletion and notability guidelines. See Wikipedia:Page Curation/Help for details. For pages listed on Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English, the Wikipedia:Embassy member of the Wikipedia that relates to the language the article is in should be contacted and invited to move the page to their own Wikipedia or to help translate it. There is also a list of translators at Wikipedia:translation. If you don't know what language the article is in you could use Language recognition chart and if that fails some language recognition web site to find out. If a page remains untranslated after two weeks, or if someone who speaks the language it is written in states that it is not worth translating, then article should be moved from pages needing translation to articles for deletion. The boilerplate text on the article should be changed from {{notenglish}} to {{subst:afd}}. Discussions Main page: Wikipedia:Dashboard Contribute your opinions to WP:noticeboards in order to have a say in decisions and help come to consensus on certain issues. Posting a message to a noticeboard can also be an appropriate early step in resolving disputes on Wikipedia. Noticeboards are best used for simple and urgent matters. There are many pages in Category:Wikipedia dispute resolution which could use help in resolving various kinds of disputes. If an editor needs a more complex response, and is willing to wait for it, the WP:Requests for comment process may be more suitable. The Dashboard provides an overview of the various discussions and requests taking place throughout English Wikipedia. People seeking help Main pages: Wikipedia:Dashboard and Wikipedia:Reference desk Even new users can help answer factual questions on the Wikipedia:Reference desk, which serves the same purpose as a reference desk you might find in your local library. (You might also think of it as the Wikipedia version of Yahoo Answers or Windows Live QnA.) You do not have to be an expert on Wikipedia because: You can help people find answers in existing Wikipedia articles. If you know the answer to a question not answered by Wikipedia, you can assist the questioner and at the same time, add that information to Wikipedia for the benefit of future readers. If you do not know the answer to an interesting question, you can research it in non-Wikipedia sources, and then improve Wikipedia for the benefit of the questioner and future readers. If you already have some experience, your assistance in one of the many Wikipedia help forums, including Wikipedia:Help desk and Wikipedia:Teahouse, would be a valuable contribution. See also, Category:Wikipedians looking for help. New editors Main page: Wikipedia:Welcoming committee Welcoming people using one of the standard user greetings is a great way to send a positive vibe. New users can be found by looking for red talk page links on recent changes or by querying the database or check Wikipedia's account creation log. You can go to Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome templates for a full list of welcome templates, or to Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome templates/Table for a visual gallery of welcome messages. The two most commonly used are {{subst:Welcome}} and {{subst:W-graphical}}. See also Wikipedia:WikiProject Editor Retention. Programming errors Main pages: Wikipedia:Developers and Wikipedia:Village pump (technical) The technical section of the village pump is used to discuss technical issues about Wikipedia. Bug reports and feature requests should be made in Phabricator (see how to report a bug). Bugs with security implications should be reported differently (see how to report security bugs). For the technical workings of Wikipedia, including software and hardware, see Wikipedia:FAQ/Technical for details. Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval Wikipedia:Bot requests Reporting software bugs meta:Toolserver/Reports Finding things to do Helpful editorial maintenance tasks include: reviewing new pages, creating requested articles, responding to edit requests, fixing spelling and grammar errors, and assisting with translation requests. Other essential maintenance tasks include: fixing unreferenced statements, fixing original research, fixing vandalism, integrating articles into the encyclopedia, welcoming newcomers, link recovery, categorization, and numerous behind the scenes tasks like moving free images to Wikimedia Commons and helping others.
