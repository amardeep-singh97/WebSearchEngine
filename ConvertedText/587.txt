These pages contain information intended to help use Wikipedia or its software. Some of these pages are intended for readers of the encyclopedia; others are intended for editors, whether beginning or advanced. Some of the pages in the Help namespace are copied from Meta-Wiki. There is a large amount of overlap between the Help namespace and the Project namespace (pages with the Wikipedia: prefix). For this reason redirects and hatnotes are often set up between these two namespaces. See Help:About the help pages for more information.
