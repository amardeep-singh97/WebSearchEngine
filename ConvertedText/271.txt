This does not include articles split from older articles. M2: For purposes of DYK, 80% new is enough to be considered "new". To add enough new material to make an article 80% new is called fivefold expansion, because four-fifths is 80%. M3: Newly promoted good articles (that weren't approved earlier) are also acceptable as new articles M4: Try to pick articles that are original to Wikipedia (not inclusions of free data sources) and interesting to a wide audience. Working on existing unsourced BLPs, such as those listed at CAT:BLP, is also most welcome – the community is working hard to ensure that all BLPs are sourced in the future, and assisting in eliminating the backlog is a valuable contribution to Wikipedia. M5: Articles that have been featured (bold link) in blurbs on the main page's In the News section are not eligible, nor are items that have been on DYK before (pre-expansion, for example). Articles that have been linked to from the mainpage but were not featured links are still eligible.
