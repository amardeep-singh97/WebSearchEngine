Wikipedia:HUMOR - Wikipedia Wikipedia:HUMOR From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Wikipedia:Humor From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace. Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles. From a modification: This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title or a closely related title. For example, the words may be rearranged. Please note that there are many more specific templates. Please use {{R from alternative spelling}} for spelling changes (including punctuation and spacing); see subcategories of Category:Redirects from modifications for other options (capitals, abbreviations, diacritics, plurals, stylizations, transliteration, ligatures, different parts of speech, etc.). If you are unsure which to use, this template is fine; someone will make it more specific later if necessary. In cases of modification from distinctly longer or shorter names, please use {{R from long name}} or {{R from short name}}, respectively. An abbreviation should be tagged with {{R from initialism}} or, if it can be spoken like a word such as NASA and RADAR, use {{R from acronym}}. Use this rcat instead of {{R from other capitalisation}} and {{R from plural}} in namespaces other than mainspace for those types of modification. This may also apply to several other subcategories of modification; please check those templates' output before saving if using outside of mainspace.
