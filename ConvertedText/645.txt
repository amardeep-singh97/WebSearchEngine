Those were the aliases that Ms. Thurston and Mr. Del Buono used as contributors to Wikipedia...." - full love story at: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/style/they-met-online-through-wikipedia-that-is.html?searchResultPosition=1 - kosboot (talk) 14:03, 16 May 2021 (UTC) Got it, thanks. It will be in In the media. Smallbones(smalltalk) 02:35, 27 May 2021 (UTC) New annual WMF fundraising record after just nine months[edit] Financial development of the Wikimedia Foundation (in US$), 2003???2020 Black: Net assets (excluding Wikimedia Endowment, currently at $90m+) Green: Revenue (excluding third-party donations to Wikimedia Endowment) Red: Expenses (including WMF payments to Wikimedia Endowment) The Wikimedia Foundation has taken $142 million in the first three quarters of this financial year ??? more than it took over the entire twelve months of the year prior. That's according to a quarterly review for the third quarter (January to March 2021) of the WMF financial year (which started 1 July 2020 and will end on 30 June 2021). The original year goal was $108 million (matching planned expenses in the annual plan); in the second quarter, this was raised to $125 million. By 31 March, the WMF had exceeded this revised target too, by $17 million. (Note also that last year the WMF underspent considerably, because so many events were cancelled. This is what led it to stash $9 million in a new Tides Advocacy fund, as people didn't know what else to do with the money. Given that the global pandemic actually accelerated over the past 10.5 months, one would expect that the same cancellations happened again.) In addition to the $142 million, the first three quarters of the year have also seen $18.6 million added to the Wikimedia Endowment. Established in 2016, the Endowment was at $90 million at the start of the year; it will reach its ten-year-goal ??? $100 million ??? five years early. As we speak, there are fundraising banners runnning in South America: 1 2 3 4. According to a Washington Post article published last week, "South America leads the world in new cases and deaths per capita." Readers there are asked to "defend Wikipedia's independence", saying a donation is required today so the WMF can continue to protect said independence. The banners add that it's the 2% of readers who donate that ensure that Wikipedia remains accessible to all. They also add that by donating money to the WMF, people can tell the volunteers that their work matters. Now given that the WMF had already exceeded its original fundraising goal by $34 million six weeks ago, the Signpost could discuss whether or not this is ethically okay ... (Also posted for discussion at Wikipedia:Village_pump_(WMF)#New_annual_WMF_fundraising_record_after_just_nine_months.) Cheers, --Andreas JN466 10:55, 17 May 2021 (UTC) Daily Dot article[edit] Wikipedia is swimming in money???why is it begging people to donate? --Andreas JN466 12:51, 24 May 2021 (UTC) You think the BBC is biased? Check out Wokepedia - The Daily Telegraph, by Andrew Orlowski. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 08:29, 27 May 2021 (UTC) Suggestion by Another Believer (2021-05-26)[edit] User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Former_WMF_employee_Harej_feels_like_shit._Why_do_I_not_feel_surprised_by_anything_he_said? ---Another Believer (Talk) 18:59, 26 May 2021 (UTC) Yeah, I just saw this at Jimbo's TP and thinking hard about it. I know James a bit and feell for him. I also know that there are interpersonal disagreements in most organizations, where some people just can't see eye-to-eye. If that's all it is, I wouldn't want to drag an un-named person's name thru the mud (I don't have a real clue on who it is). I guess I need more info (just email me please) and I should contact James as well. Still thinking. Smallbones(smalltalk) 02:50, 27 May 2021 (UTC) Suggestion by Ahecht (2021-06-01)[edit] It might be good to cover the implosion of Freenode, which hosts Wikipedia's IRC channels, as well as the migration of said channels to Libera.chat. See meta:Wikimedia_Forum#Freenode_(IRC) and Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#IRC security, Oversight notice. --Ahecht (TALK PAGE) 06:47, 1 June 2021 (UTC) New Authority control template look (2021-06-08)[edit] The Signpost should write about the new {{Authority control}} look. RfC: make Template:Authority control more reader-friendly Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 180#Authority control - Template removal discussion RfC: look of Authority Control Template talk:Authority control#Collapse these things like a deflated balloon Bamyers99 (talk) 02:30, 8 June 2021 (UTC) Suggestion (2021-06-20)[edit] The Signpost should write about Wikimedia Foundation Election 2021. The Candidates' Profile Probably better, if we can conduct an online interview for each candidates. Send Question to Candidates Rtnf (talk) 06:48, 20 June 2021 (UTC)
 I'm on it. I doubt that we can interview each one, but perhaps excerpt a short paragraph on each of the 7 so far. Smallbones(smalltalk) 01:38, 22 June 2021 (UTC) from obit comment page[edit] Image[edit] I am not sure if we should really show the image which SlimVirgin replaced shortly before she stopped editing. I read the change as her wish to not be remembered by that image. To my knowledge, she didn't use it on her user page, but on her user talk page, - so if that image please with a correct caption. For me, the image that she had on her user page all the time, and didn't change, would be a better representation. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 18:49, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Change made Gerda. Also not so sure about leading with a poem. Ceoil (talk) 01:36, 26 June 2021 (UTC) The standard of writing is not a fitting tribute to Sarah. I did a complete copy-edit (by request) today, and it has been reverted or somehow ignored. What a waste of time. Tony (talk) 13:12, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Tony1 I can see your copyedits in this diff. I'm happy to go through to check and reinstate them and then you can carry on. Does that work? Victoria (tk) 13:28, 27 June 2021 (UTC) have made a stab in this resurrection. I have to admit though, am confused by it all. Ceoil (talk) 13:38, 27 June 2021 (UTC) It was the addition of the duplicate template that caused the initial problem. ??????Serial 14:03, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Yes, it looks like that worked. Here's the version before Tony's copyedits, which differs from the current version. So the copyedits saved. Also, fwiw, am fine with the current image. Victoria (tk) 14:32, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Sound Serial and Victoria; tricky stuff! FFIW am fine with the images too. Also like the poem, its fitting, but if smallbones is reading, per Ched on your talk, prefer the blue template. Ceoil (talk) 14:50, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Also, can we archive this now resolved back-room stuff before publication; it was necessary but distracts from the gravity of the occasion. Pinging User:smallbones as editor to do this. Ceoil (talk) 15:03, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Copy edit suggestions[edit] I suggest the following minor copy edits: modify the end of the sentence In March 2005 she was nominated for adminship and promoted with a majority of 77 to 1. to "... and passed 77 to 1." remove the second "as" in The article was described by the late Brianboulton as covering "a difficult and challenging topic", and as "an important contribution to Wikipedia". It's gratifying to see so many editors collaborating together in writing this piece, which is the best recognition that can be paid. isaacl (talk) 16:15, 27 June 2021 (UTC) I changed the box as suggested. Thanks to everybody for your heko. Smallbones(smalltalk) 19:53, 27 June 2021 (U Counterpunch article[edit] T.J., Coles (June 25, 2021). "Wikipedia and the Military-Intelligence Complex: How the Free Encyclopedia Feeds the National Security State from Which It Emerged". CounterPunch. This article alleging Wikipedia upholds neoliberal capitalism and US interests could make for a good addition to the next signpost. X-Editor (talk) 05:20, 29 June 2021 (UTC) It's being panned on the comments page of the current Disinformation report rght now after a very brief mention in the article. Smallbones(smalltalk) 15:00, 29 June 2021 (UTC) @Smallbones: Could you provide a link? X-Editor (talk) 01:07, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Actually this is 6 years old, bit it's the same bug up the same orifice. Here's the new one [2]. Smallbones(smalltalk) 01:52, 30 June 2021 (UTC) @Smallbones: Sorry I didn???t make it clear, but I was asking for a link to the discussion on Wikipedia about the article. X-Editor (talk) 02:10, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2021-06-27/Forum in the comments section midway and toward the bottom. Smallbones(smalltalk) 04:32, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks! X-Editor (talk) 05:16, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Universal Code of Conduct Newsletter[edit] The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) project team at the WMF has started a monthly newsletter to aggregate the goings-on with the development of the code. I think a summary of it may fit in the "News from the WMF" section (here's an example of the summary version of the first newsletter on my meta talk page). The second edition of the newsletter is slated to come out mid-July, in time for the next Signpost issue. I'm happy to write the blurb as well, if that would be helpful. Cheers, BChoo (WMF) (talk) 23:15, 2 July 2021 (UTC) Suggestion by Mikehawk10 (2021-07-03)[edit] I'd recommend that this month's discussion report include content from the RfC's on WT:BMI and WT:MEDRS. The RfC on BMI has earned a long read from CNET, and it might be worth covering. I'm involved, so I definitely can't take it myself, but there's a lot of content there to go through if one would be interested. ??? Mikehawk10 (talk) 03:46, 3 July 2021 (UTC) Suggestion by Alexis Jazz (2021-07-03)[edit] The Signpost should write about the restriction of GFDL-licensing for file uploads. ??? Alexis Jazz (talk or ping me) 15:19, 3 July 2021 (UTC) Confirmed candidates for the 2021 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election[edit] 20 candidates were confirmed. Voting opens 4 Aug 2021. Please let me know if you have any questions. Xeno (WMF) (talk) 23:36, 3 July 2021 (UTC) Suggestion by Z1720 (2021-07-11)[edit] The Signpost should write about WP:URFA/2020, an initiative by editors to review and improve older FAs. Hog Farm will be an excellent editor to get information from.
