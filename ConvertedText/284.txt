While 200 is an outside limit, hooks slightly under 200 characters may still be rejected at the discretion of the selecting reviewers and administrators. Multiple articles are an exception. You can count the 200 characters manually. Otherwise, select the text as it displays to the public (not from the edit screen which contains wikitext), and then copy and paste it into a blank document using a free website like this, or using an external software program like Microsoft Word that has a character-counting feature. Don't use the character count on the suggestion page history screen, which includes signatures and other comments.
