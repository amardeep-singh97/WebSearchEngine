Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Does this look too complicated? Try this semi-automated process instead: 1. Install the user script DYK-helper.js. 2. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" menu from the "More" menu 3. Fill in the form and submit it. If this is your first nomination, please read the DYK rules before continuing: Official DYK criteria: DYK rules and supplementary guidelines Unofficial guide: Learning DYK To nominate an article[edit] Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Save page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Save page. How to review a nomination[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Frequently asked questions[edit] Backlogged?[edit] This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first (so that those hooks don't grow stale), it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions above). Where is my hook?[edit] If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Search archived DYK nomination discussions[edit] Instructions for other editors[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for full instructions. Hooks that have been approved are located on the approved nominations page. In one window, open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to promote. In another window, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. In the prep set... Paste the hook into the hook area (be sure to not paste in that that) Paste the credit information ({{DYKmake}} and/or {{DYKnom}}) into the credits area. Add an edit summary, e.g. "Promoted [[Jane Fonda]]", preview, and save Back on DYK nomination page... change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage change |passed= to |passed=yes Add an edit summary, e.g. "Promoted to Prep 3", preview, and save How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on February 17[edit] Koo (social network) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Koo App shot to prominence after Twitter got into a weeks-long standoff with the government of India? Source:Japan Times article ALT1:... that the social network Koo became prominent after a weeks-long standoff between Twitter and the Government of India? Created by Aman.kumar.goel (talk). Self-nominated at 11:00, 17 February 2021 (UTC). Collapsing prior review from Bahnfrend. DanCherek (talk) 22:36, 4 April 2021 (UTC) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - I checked only three of the sources, and two of them didn't support the relevant assertion. So, eg, where did the assertion that the messages are known as "Koos" come from? Similarly, where was the list of intended further languages sourced? Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: N - Can't tell yet, as the sources for some of the content are unclear. Hook: Hook has been verified by provided inline citation Cited: Y Interesting: Y QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I've added a link and made a minor amendment to the hook. Bahnfrend (talk) 12:22, 21 February 2021 (UTC) @Bahnfrend: I have addressed above issues with my recent edit. I don't think QPQ is needed because I have less than 5 nominations. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 11:23, 5 March 2021 (UTC) Extended content. DanCherek (talk) 22:12, 9 July 2021 (UTC) It has been more than two weeks, and reviewer Bahnfrend has not returned; new reviewer needed to check the issues previously raised and see whether they have been addressed so the DYK criteria are met. Many thanks. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:08, 22 March 2021 (UTC) New review by DanCherek General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - need sources for "first launched in Kannada", "Hindi", and all of the future languages. The Japan Times source says that Koo installs increased by 901,000, not that there were 901,000 installs Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: N - it would be great if the first two sentences of paragraph 3 (about Koo vs Twitter) could be reworded a little to make it more different from the source Other problems: N - there are concerns on the talk page about the article's title, and whether it should be moved to Koo (app) or Koo (social network), these should be addressed (whether or not the page is ultimately moved) prior to approval. (FWIW, I think I agree that it should be moved since the name of the app is just "Koo") Hook: Hook has been verified by provided inline citation Cited: Y Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: @Aman.kumar.goel: Thanks for your patience with this nomination, sorry for the delay. See comments above, there are a few remaining things that I think should be resolved before approval. Let me know if you have any questions. DanCherek (talk) 22:36, 4 April 2021 (UTC) @DanCherek: Fixed these issues except the last one. The concern over the title might be outdated because it was 2 months ago and this microblogging service is referred to as "Koo App" in the sources that we have used. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 12:01, 14 April 2021 (UTC) @Aman.kumar.goel: While the headlines say "Koo App", the prose in all of the sources call it "Koo", "the Koo platform", "the Koo app", etc., with no capitalization in "app". Reference [7] says: It is named just ???Koo??? on the App Store with Bombinate Technologies Private Limited as the provider. I think it's similar to how we have articles titled Twitter and Snapchat rather than "Twitter App" and "Snapchat App". Also, "first launched in Kannada", "Hindi", and all of the future languages should be sourced ??? I'm being annoying about this because if the unsourced material is removed it starts to approach the 1,500-character minimum DYK threshold. Thanks, let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to open it up for more opinions from WT:DYK. DanCherek (talk) 20:14, 15 April 2021 (UTC) Hi Aman.kumar.goel; are you going to return to make the changes that the reviewer asked you about? It's been nearly a month now. If we don't hear from you in the next few days, this nomination will have to be closed. MeegsC (talk) 21:04, 10 May 2021 (UTC) Nominator has been unable to respond. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 01:17, 15 May 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5 and MeegsC: I have resolved all issues now. Let me know if any problems exist. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 05:20, 16 May 2021 (UTC) DanCherek, how is it looking now? Do you approve it, or are there still issues? MeegsC (talk) 08:11, 16 May 2021 (UTC) Sigh... it's undergoing a big expansion by another user which is great for the article but always complicates things here. @Aman.kumar.goel: With the new content added by Badassboy 63637, there are now sections that need further copy-editing (e.g. capitalization issues, external links removal) and sources needed (e.g. "Most Followed Accounts" is unsourced). I also note the three editors on the talk page who are in support of a title change. DanCherek (talk) 12:31, 16 May 2021 (UTC) @Aman.kumar.goel: Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 06:07, 25 May 2021 (UTC) Article has been moved to Koo (social network); I have adjusted this page to reflect the move except for the hook, which I'm not sure how to adjust beyond the link to the article. BlueMoonset (talk) 14:57, 26 May 2021 (UTC) Does this need a GOCE copyedit? Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 05:46, 27 May 2021 (UTC) The prose is generally fine and GOCE is probably not necessary; DYK-compliant sourcing is the only thing preventing this from being approved right now. DanCherek (talk) 14:13, 30 May 2021 (UTC) After all the recent edits to the article, I don't see any serious issue with the article right now. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 10:56, 1 June 2021 (UTC) There are two paragraphs in the article that are unsourced (in "Format, interface and features" and "Most followed accounts"); they need to be sourced per WP:DYKSG.

Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 05:27, 9 June 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 07:31, 12 June 2021 (UTC) Pinging DanCherek to see whether the latest changes solve the sourcing issues. Thanks. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:21, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks for the ping! All paragraphs sourced now so approving. DanCherek (talk) 02:26, 14 June 2021 (UTC) The article refers to the app as Koo, Koo App, and Koo app. Which one is it? The hook doesn't sound that great with "got into a". Maybe ALT1 ... that the social network Koo became prominent after a weeks-long standoff between Twitter and the Government of India? SL93 (talk) 05:21, 14 June 2021 (UTC) ALT1 looks fine to me. Thanks. DanCherek (talk) 14:37, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Unreferenced contact was just added to the article. SL93 (talk) 06:05, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Already removed by other editor. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 14:34, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Aman.kumar.goel Can you make the article consistent with what the subject is? SL93 (talk) 16:56, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Some sections read like an advert, others like a howto. Desertarun (talk) 21:23, 16 June 2021 (UTC) I don't think those issues necessarily make this nomination ineligible, rather it merely means that additional work is needed to bring the article up to standard. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 04:04, 18 June 2021 (UTC) @Aman.kumar.goel: This is your final ping; if the issues are not addressed in a reasonable timeframe, the nomination will be closed. It is now the oldest active nomination and progress needs to be done if this is to be passed. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 16:07, 23 June 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5 and SL93: All issues have been resolved. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 23:29, 24 June 2021 (UTC) The article has already been tagged again. This is hopeless. Desertarun (talk) 08:12, 25 June 2021 (UTC) I don't see any tagging for hours. It clearly seems that the issues have been resolved. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 23:53, 25 June 2021 (UTC) There's a "primary sources" section tag that needs to be resolved. Schwede66 09:11, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Resolved by removing the primary source and merging in the existing section. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 10:15, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Pinging DanCherek and SL93, now that the article seems to have settled down. If the issues have been adequately addressed and the article meets the DYK criteria, perhaps this is ready to be approved. BlueMoonset (talk) 00:53, 3 July 2021 (UTC) I've removed an unsourced statement from the article, but otherwise I think it's fine for DYK. DanCherek (talk) 03:24, 4 July 2021 (UTC) DanCherek, in that case, are you willing to give this the appropriate tick icon? I don't think we'll be hearing from SL93; they've been quite active in the past few days yet haven't responded here. Thanks. BlueMoonset (talk) 22:44, 6 July 2021 (UTC) Yes, sorry for the oversight! DanCherek (talk) 23:13, 6 July 2021 (UTC) Sorry, the word prominent in the hook is both Wp:Promo and WP:POV. Also the article is still using words like shot to prominence. Desertarun (talk) 10:25, 8 July 2021 (UTC) There is no "POV" about it. See WP:DONTLIKEIT. I hope reviewers will ignore your comment since you haven't suggested anything but appear to be only trying to fail this nomination. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 03:22, 9 July 2021 (UTC) I agree with Desertarun, "shot to prominence" is puffery, and even "became prominent" is too much. I've edited the article to remove it, replacing it with 'got a boost' which looks like what the source supporting the assertion is saying? (Can't get to the whole article, but we'd need an attributed quote to ever use words like "shot to prominence".) I think the hook needs to be toned down further, perhaps to 'got a boost'? Aman.kumar.goel, please assume good faith, here. I understand that the peer review process is difficult, but you can't go around accusing other editors of trying to fail a nomination. The phrase "shot to prominence" absolutely is not neutral, so it is a POV problem. ???valereee (talk) 10:57, 9 July 2021 (UTC) Well, I'd be surprised if valereee actually reckons that as puffery. A bit of generally written articles always have idioms, metaphors or phrases. Unless we are writing Simple English Wikipedia or it looks like an advertisement or a plain storyline or violates source, IMO it's fine. Same language is written quite neatly in WP:RS too. [2] [3] Also, what is the toned version if you can suggest? Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 03:39, 10 July 2021 (UTC) ALT2a:... that the social network Koo increased in popularity after the 2020???2021 Indian farmers' protest caused a weeks-long standoff between Twitter and the government of India? ALT2b:... that the social network Koo got a boost after the 2020???2021 Indian farmers' protest caused a weeks-long standoff between Twitter and the government of India? ALT3:... that the user base of social network Koo had a surge after the 2020???2021 Indian farmers' protest caused a weeks-long standoff between Twitter and the government of India? I think all of those sound more neutral. ???valereee (talk) 08:50, 10 July 2021 (UTC) Thank you for working on this. I support ALT2a and have modified the article to reflect this. Aman Kumar Goel (Talk) 09:29, 10 July 2021 (UTC) Need someone to approve ALT2a. ???valereee (talk) 10:46, 10 July 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on May 2[edit] Norman K. Risjord ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that historian Norman K. Risjord worked in counter-intelligence in Berlin before he obtained his Phd and pursued a career in American history? Sources:  Norman K. Risjord: University of Wisconsin, biography;  Memorials: Norman Risjord, Omohundro Institute Reviewed: Template:Did you know nominations/Kammermusik (Hindemith) Comment: Statement and sources supporting hook are found in the Early life and education section in the article. Created by Gwillhickers (talk). Self-nominated at 18:42, 5 May 2021 (UTC). I am willing to review it, but first, the subject's notability is not clear. Could you elaborate here or on the article's talk how they meet WP:NPROF/WP:NBIO and ping me? The current sources for the article are low-key obituaries from his Department and funeral home, hardly independent (one presumably written by his colleagues at work, the other by his family and friends). I'll continue the review once the notability is made clear. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 07:37, 27 May 2021 (UTC) @Piotrus: -- Risjord is noted in the academic and historical community for having authored more than twenty books on American history. That he worked for US intelligence before pursuing a career in history also makes him interesting, imo. The article is for reference, as Risjord's name occurs from time to time in other works of history. I wouldn't go so far as to say he's famous, but he is noted among historians and the like. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 23:01, 3 June 2021 (UTC) [Add] Risjord's studies and writings about the birth and development of US political party system that emerged after the American Revolution were published in six separate volumes, and are considered standard works on the development of the early American party system. There is no other historian who has written in this important area of study nearly as much as Risjord has. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 20:38, 10 June 2021 (UTC) Gwillhickers, Hmmm, I am still seeing those assertions as made by a Wikipedian but not backed up reliable sources. I will ping User:Randykitty here for a quick sanity check. What do you think, Randy? AfD or am I missing something? If you think it is notable I'll be happy to finish reviewing this. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 04:55, 19 June 2021 (UTC) @Piotrus and Randykitty: Thanks. We should keep in mind that 'notability' is usually based on one's accomplishments and that any notability is usually limited to those interested in the subject. For example, an article on a given video game is only notable in the eyes of video-gamers. Risjord is noted in the American history historical world for his many Works|works on history, esp where it concerns the US party system that emerged after the American Revolution - a very important component of American history, often ignored. Like other accomplished writers this is Risjord's claim to notability. Hope his many scholarly accomplishments will be notable enough. Risjord is often referenced by other writers so if need be I can add these items to the narrative. I'll continue looking for other sources. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 17:28, 18 June 2021 (UTC) Actually, that is not correct. Notability is not based on accomplishments, but on being "noted" as evidenced by in-depth discussion in reliable sources independent of the subject. I see here only 2 independent sources: the Hickey book and an article from the same author. I checked the book and there a only a handful in-passing mentions, nothing coming close to the coverage needed for notability. The article is even worse, mentioning Risjord just once in a list of sources. If Risjord was indeed as valued as you claiam, then there should be sources certifying that. If this is all (Goodreads, seriously?), then this is not only unsuited for DYK but ripe for AfD. Sorry for being so harsh, I understand and appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in this... --Randykitty (talk) 18:58, 18 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks for being candid. Yes, we need more than one independent source that indeed says Risjord is a noted scholar in his field. Hickey maintains Risjord's works on the US party system are the standard reference on this subject. I only meant to say that accomplishments come first, and then, maybe, notability follows. Apparently it hasn't in this case, even though Risjord's name appears in the Bibliographies of many books on the history of the US government in the early days. As I said, I will look to other scholarly accounts which mention Risjord's distinguished accomplishments in the study of early US history. -- If I come up with any such independent sources I'll ping you and we can go from there. Otherwise, I'll just withdraw the nomination and hope the AfD axe doesn't come down on the article. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 20:00, 18 June 2021 (UTC) Gwillhickers, I really dislike being a party-pooper or the resident "deletionist", particularly as I believe we are suffering from systemic bias against academics (or pro-celeberities). Nonetheless, I think there is no middle ground. If he is notable, this is eligible for DYK. If he is not, this is not eligible for an article (and your effort can be at best userfied, waiting for a day sources about him appear - it is possible, some scholars are written about by their peers and students and such, but it can takes years or decades). For the record, I do believe we should have articles about such people who should be notable, but it is not up to us to say they are - his peers and colleagues and so on need to go through the effort of writing at least one (and preferably three articles about him). That is the requirement for one to have an entry in an encyclopedia. Until such sources exist, he may not be notable. (That said, see also supplementary notes at WP:PROF, maybe he can squeeze by one of the other criteria; not that long ago I AfD an Asian vice rector of a minor university with no citations / research who got kept per consensus that vice rectors of all Commonwealth countries are automatically notable due to meeting some aspect of PROF...). --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 04:55, 19 June 2021 (UTC) Book Reviews Asking for three complete articles on writers it would seem is a bit much, considering that the guideline referred to only says Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, but it does not need to be the main topic of the source material. Also, I am more concerned with 'what' an independent source says, rather than how many sentences or paragraphs, so I'm hoping we don't use a 'word count' of sorts to measure the weight a source may lend to Risjord. Having authored dozens of books, Risjord's area of expertise is distinguished and some of his works are considered the standard authority, so there's a likely chance there are others besides Hickey who definitively say so. I'll continue to search through the other sources. Risjord's names occurs in many works on American history, and in particular, Thomas Jefferson and post Revolutionary War developments, so there's still hope here that there's some ample coverage about the person himself. Will be prompt about the search. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 19:05, 19 June 2021 (UTC) I suggest you start looking for reviews of his books, those might be more substantial than those Hickey sources (which in one case are just a citation and in the other not even a complete sentence). In the field of history, books are the way to publish and many journals will publish reviews of books in their field of interest. If no reviews of his books can be found, then I'd say that more or less proves non-notability (insofar as a negative can be proven, of course). --Randykitty (talk) 22:11, 19 June 2021 (UTC) Gwillhickers, FYI, one article would make me not bother with AfD. Or even a detailed paragraph. Heck, a sentence calling him or his work significant would be of use too. Believe it or not, I do have (what I consider) relaxed standards when it comes to academics, it is just that they are still not met here - we are missing even one, independent, in-depth source about him. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 03:23, 20 June 2021 (UTC) I've come across these book reviews of Risjord's work so far. In terms of recognition and praise given to Risjord, these reviews don't come right out and say that Risjord's works are a standard authority, but they do support the idea that Risjord is a well recognized, accomplished and insightful writer in his field. Review: By, Cox, Richard J., Baltimore City Archives Book: Chesapeake Politics, 1781-1800, by Norman K. Risjord (1978) ISBN 9780231043281 Cox ??????

Breslaw, University of Tennessee, Knoxville Book: Builders of Annapolis: Enterprise and Politics in a Colonial Capital, By Norman K. Risjord. (1997) ISBN 0-938420-60-7 Breslaw ?????? "This is good popular history. The author chronicles the development of Annapolis in the eighteenth century through the lives of nine families who contributed to the architectural and institutional development of the town. Risjord, now retired from the history department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is best known for his description of Chesapeake Politics, 1781-1800 (New York, 1978) and a series of biographical sketches of Representative Americans.[a] Drawing on an array of secondary sources, he brings to this portrait of elite Annapolis colonials a wealth of human interest stories and insightful observations."[2] Review: By Harry Hellenbrand, University of Minnesota, Duluth Book: Thomas Jefferson, by Norman K. Risjord (1994) ISBN 9780945612391 Hellenbrand ?????? "Norman K. Risjord's brief biography of Jefferson is the work of a seasoned professional who has devoted his scholarly career to the study of the Jeffersonian period in American history. While modestly describing his book as a brief outline of Jefferson's career for a general audience, Risjord actually presents an insightful analysis of Jefferson's character and beliefs and an incisive account of his impact on his times. Risjord is especially strong in showing how Jefferson managed to combine strong elements of classical republicanism and Lockean liberalism in his political ideology and in tracing how the balance between them constantly shifted in response to changing circumstances. Firmly in command of the sources, Risjord, in slightly more than 200 pages, leads the reader authoritatively through the main stages of development in Jefferson's career and provides a convincing assessment of his place in American history."[3] References ^ Cox, Richard J., (Emphasis added) ^ Breslaw, [1], pp. 382-383 ^ Hellenbrand review:, p. 266-267 Notes ^ These works are listed in the article. Thanks to both of you for your advice and patience. Continuing the search. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 19:17, 20 June 2021 (UTC) Gwillhickers, A quick tip: I found that LibGen is good at returning book reviews that GScholar missed. Anyway, while I don't think reviews of one's book lend themselves to the notability of the author directly (per WP:NOTINHERITED), we do have something to work with here: Risjord, now retired from the history department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is best known for his description of Chesapeake Politics, 1781-1800 (New York, 1978) and a series of biographical sketches of Representative Americans. and a seasoned professional who has devoted his scholarly career to the study of the Jeffersonian period in American history. That's good, and for me would be enough to compromise (leave the notability template in, but no need for AfD; the reason I see it as a constructive is that the article is tagged for improvement and hopefully will eventually attract someone who will add more sources, once they exist; that's of course is assuming you don't find anything more right now). --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 04:50, 21 June 2021 (UTC) I broke this subsection titled "Book reviews", as it seems to be working through the WP:Notability (academics), "Academics meeting any one of the following conditions, as substantiated through reliable sources, are notable."

Criteria #6. "The person has had a substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity." - Consistent with the "Wisconsin Idea" from a 1905 University Presidential address, "I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every family of the state." Risjord broadcast his university lectures in American history on NPRs Wisconsin Public Radio for twenty years 1967-1989. See the Newsletter for the Participatory Learning and Teaching Organization, PLATO Weekly Update 2/5/2019 by Michael Stevens. - Risjord's PLATO lectures were aimed first at the program's principle audience, senior Wisconsin residents nearing retirement. They began in a 25-student classroom, then expanded to the Madison Senior Center at Capitol Lakes, and finally filling the 200-seat auditorium each semester at the Oakwood Village West residence campus. see PLATO Weekly Update 2/5/2019. - Risjord he wrote a secondary schools textbook on American History, published by (1979) Pearson, and (1983) Holt, Rinehart and Winston. He followed that in 1984 with a college-level textbook, America: A History of the United States, reprinted (1988) Pearson College Division, which both reflected well on his high school textbook, which was "outside academia", but in his "academic capacity". At three reliably sourced examples, Norman K. Risjord may be found to be WP:notable for one criteria, #6. s/TheVirginiaHistorian (talk) 18:34, 22 June 2021 (UTC) I am still not convinced he is notable, but he is borderline, and I am not very motivated to take him to AfD (since I lean on the incusionist side of such borderline cases). I am however not prepared to pass this for DYK, as I believe the notability tag has to say in the article until it survives a trial by fire at AfD, and as long as it is there, this is not eligible for a DYK. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 05:27, 25 June 2021 (UTC) @Randykitty, Piotrus, and TheVirginiaHistorian: ??? We should be using Subject-specific notability guidelines for notability. The notability criteria for athletes, books, music, academia, etc are different. Notability for academics is what we should have been considering. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 19:06, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia:Notability (academics) In terms of Notability in the academic world, Risjord meets at least three of the criteria for historians here at WP: 1. The person's research has had a significant impact in their scholarly discipline, broadly construed, as demonstrated by independent reliable sources.[a] 5. The person has held a named chair appointment or distinguished professor appointment at a major institution[b] 7. The person has had a substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity.[c] -- Gwillhickers (talk) 19:56, 23 June 2021 (UTC) Notes ^ Risjord's extensive research and writing in the area of early American representation is cited by numerous independent reliable sources, some of whom regard these works as an academic standard. ^ Risjord has had tenure as a professor at several institutions, including the Universities of Wisconsin, Columbia University and the US Naval Academy - a teaching career that spanned 60 years. ^ Risjords lectures on history were broadcasted over public radio, a public service not connected with any university curriculum. After retirement, Risjord continued to do volunteer teaching at PLATO, a continuing education institution under the auspices of Wisconsin University, for two decades, up until months before he died. Given his many years of involvement in numerous areas of the academic realm (Professorships, books, journals, etc), Risjord's notability is well established. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 18:32, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Sorry to disagree. Being cited does not indicate a significant impact, particularly when it has not been noted in secondary sources. Charles Beard for example had an impact because his view that economic interest was a driver of both the U.S. Revolution and the Civil War was adopted by leading historians, although he is less popular now. None of Riford's teaching positions were named chairs or distinguished professorships. His post-retirement work cannot be considered to have had a substantial impact unless it is reported extensively in reliable sources. TFD (talk) 19:22, 25 June 2021 (UTC) We've been through this. Some of Risjord's work are considered a standard, or the best, in its area of study, as noted by independent reliable sources, Hickey and Cox. He's done much more than having been cited in other works to achieve notability in the modern academic world. Risjord meets three of the criteria, esp number 5. As a writer he doesn't require a specific acclamation from a specific source to achieve notability in the realm of histiography, even though this has happened. His professorships alone, not to mention his many recognized works, give him notability. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 21:11, 25 June 2021 (UTC) See Professors in the United States#Special academic ranks (tenured). A named chair appointment is an appointment that contains a name, while distinguished professor is a title awarded to particularly esteemed professors. So for example John Smith may be appointed the Charles A. Beard Professor of History or be called Distinguished Professor Smith. AFAIK neither applies. TFD (talk) 01:10, 26 June 2021 (UTC) In criteria 5, the phrase "distinguished professor appointment", which is not capitalized, per official titles, is one among many such titles given to the various top professors in universities. They include titles such as, "president's professor", "university professor", "distinguished professor", "distinguished research professor", "distinguished teaching professor", also listed in the article/section linked to. Risjord was a professor at several major universities, including Wisconsin State, for many years. I hope you're not expecting to find a source that spells out the phrase distinguished professor in reference to Risjord. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 19:25, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Risjord was Professor Emeritus at Wisconsin University, a title only given to a select few distinguished professors at retirement, which satisfies criteria 5. Risjord's lectures on history were broadcasted over public radio, a public service not connected with any university curriculum, which, along with his efforts with PLATO, should satisfy criteria 7. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 20:15, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Well no the term "distinguished professor" is not capitalized, but neither is the term professor. While a professor would be styled Professor John Smith, a distinguished professor would be styled Distinguished Professor John Smith or University Professor John Smith. Here's a list of distinguished professors at the University of Toronto. Notice there are fewer than 40 of them out of a total faculty of over 2,500. Also, professor emeritus is not equivalent to distinguished professor. As your link shows, the University of Wisconsin applies the term to all retired professors. If you are not willing to concede this, I will take it to a noticeboard. TFD (talk) 22:26, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Professor is a tile of rank in academic pursuits, and is always capitalized when used to refer to an individual. Also, what link/source says that Wisconsin U. gives the title Emeritus to all its retiring professors? If the title was simply given away as some bonus or gift to all retiring professors, it would make the award/title sort of meaningless. Please see Emeritus Status, Univ. of Wisconsin, requiring long time distinguished service. According to our WP Emeritus article, it says, "..it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded only to a few on retirement." Also, there's really no need to go to a incident noticeboard to sort this stuff out. An RfC would be more appropriate, but at this point moot, as only one criteria need be met to establish notability in the academic world. Risjord has met several, as outlined above. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 23:10, 26 June 2021 (UTC) The Wikipedia article you linked to says, "In some cases, the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank, but in others, it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded only to a few on retirement." Madison allows retired professors with 10 years of distinguished service to apply. The history department currently has 35 professors emeriti.[4] The department of Department of Planning and Landscape Architecture, which has a page for all former faculty, lists 15 retired professors, of whom 14 are professors emeriti.[5] And even though almost all retiring professors become emeriti, it's not meaningless because it allows them to use university sources and remain part of the university community. TFD (talk) 00:03, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Yes, as the WP article says, " it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded only to a few on retirement." Awards are given for accomplishments, distinguished service, more than to merely offer University resources, etc. Again, Emeritus Status Wisconsin U. makes it clear as to what basis they offer a title of Emeritus Professor. Though others may have been awarded the title, it does not diminish Risjord's distinguished accomplishments, (very) often cited by others, in an area of study most often treated in a cursory fashion - pursuits which go far beyond those of average professors. It seems you're trying to suggest that Risjord is no more notable than the average professor, most of whom only publish a nominal amount of work in areas of study most often well covered by many others already. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 17:15, 27 June 2021 (UTC) @Piotrus: As you well intended, this nomination was originally reviewed under the auspices of general guidelines for people, where links to Subject-specific guidelines are also listed, including those pertaining to Academics. Quoting from this page, "This guideline reflects consensus about the notability of academics as measured by their academic achievements", and, "This guideline is independent from the other subject-specific notability guidelines ... and is explicitly listed as an alternative to the general notability guideline." Using the criteria for academics, Risjord's notability as an academic is based on criteria 1, 2, 5, and 7, which has been outlined by two editors, including myself, on the Risjord Talk page, beginning here. A reviewer is needed to evaluate the nomination under notability guidelines for academics. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 00:18, 7 July 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on May 7[edit] American Pre-Raphaelites ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the American Pre-Raphaelite painters had an obsession with depicting birds' nest still lifes?

There are major problems with the references in this article; many don't support the statements made. For example, ref1 does say that Ruskin's book struck a chord with the Transcendalists, but p. 44 says nothing about plein air painting. Ref3 doesn't mention Emerson or Norton at all, and it doesn't mention Ruskin's painting. The last phrase in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the History section isn't supported by any source. Ref9 has the wrong page number; the article states that Richards became a marine painter on pp. 5 and 14. I'm sure you get my point, so I'll stop here. I'm unable to verify the sources in several refs because they're inaccessible, but I wouldn't be surprised if they suffered from the same issues. At any rate, this is a concerning issue with this article. The first hook is fine, but there's nothing in the article about Bierstadt's painting. There are major issues with the prose, which is secondary to the problems with the utilization of sources. The paragraphs are too short, probably because not enough information from the sources are included, giving this article a problem with comprehensiveness. I can't pass this article in its current state. I recommend that you remove the nomination, give up the DYK, and work on how you use sources. Christine (Figureskatingfan) (talk) 21:01, 31 May 2021 (UTC) To your citation criticism: Ref1 was to connect Ruskin to Transcendental ideals, not plein air painting. Both the use of plein air painting and the popularity of Modern Painters are established by Ref3. Ref4 is to establish that Norton and Emerson in fact read Modern Painters. In Ref8 (I assume you meant), the relevant information is on the 12th page of the pdf???a mistake, yes, but a small one. As for the 4th graf of the history section, you'll notice that ref10 also establishes that the American Pre-Raphaelites criticized Bierstadt. The specific claim about the criticism of manifest destiny is verifiable in the Ferber 2019 source, which I have not had time to track down IRL. To me, none of this adds up to a "concerning issue" that fails to meet WP:V and can't be resolved w/ 1-2 edits. (As an aside, I wish you had phrased your criticism constructively instead of throwing your hands up.) I do not believe the article's paragraphs are too short, and their length is not a result of "not enough information". I break paragraphs often because they help structure information for a reader. As far as I know, DYK does not have a comprehensiveness criteria, so I don't know why "a problem with comprehensiveness" is even part of the rationale for failing this nomination. At ~4200b, this article is well over the 1,500b requirement. ???Wingedserif (talk) 02:17, 1 June 2021 (UTC) Having taken a quick look at this, I'm as baffled as User:Wingedserif as to why User:Figureskatingfan has reacted this harshly. I don't see "major issues with the prose"; what issues there are are minor enough to be addressed as part of this review. The paragraphs aren't unduly short and a "problem with comprehensiveness" would be relevant at Good Article Review but is odd grounds for denying a DYK. I urge the reviewer to give the author a chance to resolve the minor problems with the article. This could be a constructive and positive process, resulting in better quality articles, if we choose it to be. MartinPoulter (talk) 14:21, 1 June 2021 (UTC) Sorry that I came across as harsh, I was trying to help make the article better. Yes, my comments about comprehensiveness are more general than what's needed more DYK, but I think that if the nominator followed my suggestions, it would improve it. I said that I couldn't pass it for DYK based upon the issues with the references and the utilization of sources; sorry if that wasn't made clear. I also was concerned that the same issues would appear in the sources that aren't accessible, which I suspect they do. My point is that your references need to support your statements and claims. I see that your statement about plein air painting is supported by ref3, but putting ref1 after the word "ideals," makes it look like the ref is supporting the entire phrase, including the claim about plein air painting. The solution, I think, is to put ref1 at the end of the sentence. Yes, this is being picky, but it was easy for me to assume that ref1 supports both claims when it doesn't, so the simple solution is to move the ref. I think that if an article lands on the main page, it needs to be accurate. If you fix the above issues, I'll assume that you fixed the issues about the inaccessible references and sources and will pass this for DYK. Christine (Figureskatingfan) (talk) 17:09, 1 June 2021 (UTC) I see that you've resolved the above issues, so I'm passing this for DYK. Unrelated to this DYK: I think that this article has great potential for improvement, so I suggest that you work on it some more. I also suggest that you remove the "Legacy" section and put the one sentence in another place in the article, until you add more content about the American Pre-Raphaelites' affect on American art. That way, you can remove the tag. Thanks, best to you. Christine (Figureskatingfan) (talk) 16:31, 2 June 2021 (UTC) @Figureskatingfan: yay, thank you! (And thank you for looking through the additional edits; I do appreciate the time and care you've taken with this review.) I'm glad that adding the quotes for the supporting citations helped clarify what of the existing text is supported by each source. And I absolutely agree: there are essentially three full books on the movement to expand the article, which I'm hoping to get to when my life becomes less hectic ????. ???Wingedserif (talk) 03:11, 3 June 2021 (UTC) You're welcome. I know that it's annoying when DYK reviewers review more than what's necessary, but for me, it's because I sincerely want articles (especially those that'll appear on the main page) become as good as they can. Sometimes we need to clarify the difference between comments made for the review and the comments made for improvement sake. Make sure, after you do your research with those three books, that you submit this for GAN. Who knows, maybe you'll become our resident expert on the American Pre-Raphaelites. ; Best to you, keep up the good work.

Created by Amitabho (talk). Self-nominated at 01:05, 15 May 2021 (UTC). The article is long enough and new enough. It is written in an encyclopedic style with inline references. There are a few cases of bare URLs being used as references (ref 5, 8, and 23 in the current version); please express them as formatted citations. I think ref 23 should be treated carefully: this is a "newsroom alert" by a law firm, so it is written by a professional expert but it is effectively self-published. I think the text should attribute it as the analysis of one particular firm rather than stating it as fact. The copyvio detector finds a lot of text common between the article and existing sources, especially in the sections on Commercial speech and Exceptions, where you've reproduced some of the legal code. If we are dealing with legal text that is in the public domain, then it would be okay to reuse it: I don't know if that's the case with California State law as opposed to Federal law, so I welcome clarification on this. In the lead, the phrase "speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law" seems to be verbatim from an existing source, maybe itself drawing from the legal code. It needs to be rephrased unless the legal code itself is in the public domain, in which case the source needs to be cited. You've helpfully provided web links for most of the legal documents cited, and I have to assume good faith on the rest: if you provide web links for more of the citations, that's welcome but not mandatory. I think the original hook is a bit hard to take in with its multiple clauses referring to three different courts, but ALT1 expresses an interesting and digestable fact. This fact is expressed in the article with a suitable inline source. A QPQ seems to be not necessary in this case as the nominator has not made 5 DYK noms. You've done good work creating an accessible overview of a piece of legislation and there are just small changes needed to get this to the required standard (fix citations and clarify the copyright status, or rephrase text where necessary). MartinPoulter (talk) 14:04, 1 June 2021 (UTC) Having looked up [8] it seems that the legal code on that site is in the public domain, so there isn't a copyright issue, but I ask you to just make sure that every time public domain text is used there is a citation to attribute it: the Commercial speech/ Exemptions sections look okay in this regard, but there is also that "speech made in connection with..." part of the lead which needs citation or rewording.

The sentence in the lead - "The agreement was signed at what is now the Red Rock Village Museum in Chongqing." - should be referenced and it would probably be best for it to also be in the body of the article. The first paragraph in the China in 1945 section needs citations. "The battles resulted in a victory for Mao and the CCP which skewed the negotiations to Mao's favour." under the Events section needs a citation at the end, but I do see that the information is in the citation in the next paragraph so it should be easy to just repeat it up above.

Students using the building have reported mysterious phenomena and the faint voice of a woman sounding from nowhere." Source:[10] Created by Chevsapher (talk). Nominated by JustinMal1 (talk) at 13:46, 17 May 2021 (UTC). Article new and long enough, generally well written but poorly sourced. I would go so far as to say most of the article is unsourced or the sources aren't clear. I also highly recommend moving the article to English Building, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Just about every university will have an "English building", and many of them will be officially called that, let alone all the buildings named after people called English, or representing England at various events. It needs the disambiguation unless you think it's undoubtedly the main thing in existence referred to as "English building" (the answer is no, it isn't). What sources are used appear to be almost entirely primary sources, not indicating that it has outside notability. I am also concerned that Chevsapher has undisclosed COI (editing behavior)? Similarly, I would like more information on the licenses for the images in the article. But you and JustinMal1 still have a few more days to work on the article before it would even be too late to nominate for DYK, and I'd offer a grace period for improvements after that date (24th) too. Kingsif (talk) 17:27, 21 May 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the helpful feedback. To address your points: ~95% of the article is sourced, and the few statements that are not sourced are common general knowledge. If I need to change the citation style, I am happy to do so. I like the suggestion about creating disambiguation page, and I saw that JustinMal1 just moved the article to the suggested namespace. Concerning the potential COI, I am a student at the university, but I am not affiliated with the units that occupy the building. If this is still qualifiable as a COI, I will stop editing University of Illinois articles. The images' origins and licenses are explained on their Wikimedia pages. The photos I personally uploaded are photos I took myself. I tried to avoid primary sources, but I will agree that many of the secondary sources are internal to the university. To add more external sources, I would need to dig more into two main reasons why the building is externally relevant, which are (1) it was designed by the pre-eminent architectural firm of the Beaux-Arts era, and (2) it was the home of one of the most influential early home economics departments in the U.S., whose research helped drive the early-20th-century revolution in domestic efficiency. I would love to flesh out this article more fully, but unfortunately, my time is limited. I cannot yet commit to spending a few full days with a stack of books. Chevsapher (talk) 17:51, 22 May 2021 (UTC) Kingsif, it's been over a month, and no significant edits have been made to the article, though it was moved as you suggested. Can you please take a look at Chevsapher's response and the article itself, and determine whether the nomination should proceed? Thank you very much. BlueMoonset (talk) 03:21, 3 July 2021 (UTC) There are at least 3 paragraphs without a single citation, and many others with only one that clearly applies to only a sentence or two. Since the article is so short, that's nowhere near "95% sourced". Citation style hasn't accepted "common knowledge" or "dump a bibliography at the end" for a long time now, so I refuse to believe anyone thinks this could be adequate. Kingsif (talk) 12:00, 3 July 2021 (UTC) For each "paragraph without a single citation," just go down to the next paragraph and find the first source cited. For example, the first 2 paragraphs under "Architecture" are both sourced from [9], with the citation sitting in the second paragraph. If this is not proper formatting, I am happy to change it. The only "common knowledge" statement is the sentence about which units currently occupy the building; a quick Google search will confirm their locations. All other information is sourced from the citations, and if you have any doubts, you are welcome to check. Chevsapher (talk) 18:28, 7 July 2021 (UTC) Chevsapher, citations do not cover multiple paragraphs on Wikipedia. If a source is used for consecutive paragraphs, each paragraph must cite the source. Google search is not adequate; if you cannot find an actual source for the material, since it has been challenged, then it shouldn't be included in the article.

At the moment, the article is 14579 prose characters, so another 3431 prose characters need to be added. In addition, the article in that case would have been nominated ten days after the May 17 expansion began rather than seven days; since this is a new user, leniency could be allowed for the three-day delay if the further expansion is done. Carrolquadrio, Elli, is a further expansion feasible, and could it be done soon? Thanks for the submission and coming back to it.

Today the gourd is replaced by a piece of wood cut in the same" and later "In China the mouth organ is said to have been invented by Emperor Nyu-kwa in the third millennium B.C. as an imitation of the bird Phoenix" and "In the most highly developed form of the raft-shaped mouth organ, in Middle and South Laos, the two rafts, sometimes as tall as twelve feet, are laid on top of each other and this double raft pierces through an elongated, wooden windchest". Sachs is discussing mouth organs not specifically gourd mouth organs, making me wonder if these refs are applicable or not. I don't know?

Tbhotch the source is correct, in fact there were a number of charts this appeared on. You are looking at the Hot Latin Songs chart for the 12 week figure, which is correct. The article no longer references anything that is 10 weeks long, but the actual thing that is being referenced is the the Latin Pop Airplay charts, which is indeed 11 weeks.

JeBonSer (talk | sign) 11:00, 21 June 2021 (UTC) The following were my comments at WT:DYK that didn't touch on the QPQ issue: I am also concerned about the article's sourcing and use thereof. What makes the Google Arts & Culture site reliable (I've found basic fact issues with their articles before), and, for that matter, the Web Gallery of Art, which seems to have been created by a retired physicist and a computer scientist. (That WGoA entry reads as if it were taken, uncredited, from a book of paintings.) While I have no quarrel with the Art Institute of Chicago, I am concerned with how the material is being used: the article states, in Wikipedia's voice, The artist also littered skulls and bones on the ground with lizards to make it look gritty. This claim of artistic intent comes somehow from the source's Martorell also treated the ground, littered with bones and crawling with lizards, in a lively manner, giving it a gritty texture. Once the article is pulled for the needed replacement QPQ, I recommend that it be given a closer examination before being passed again. JeBonSer, these issues need to addressed. BlueMoonset (talk) 22:30, 21 June 2021 (UTC) This needs more than a bit of a copyedit. Gritty--"to make it look gritty"? There is no antecedent for it. The sentence that starts "Dressed in a robe" is ungrammatical. I don't know how a scene can rise steeply, and that sentence has a comma splice. The next sentence has an unwarranted "however", and "this valley"--which valley? And "that separates from the foreground to the background"--what does it separate? "We can determine"--we don't do "we". I was thinking that might have been a copyvio, but it's not, it's an unsuccessful attempt at paraphrase. No, there is no way this should be on the front page. Johnbod and Cwmhiraeth commented on the Bibliography, which wasn't, and is now a Further reading--first of all, I'm going to pretend I never read that "It comes straight from the Art Institute Chicago website", and pretend that I think that the article writer actually knows this material, which is what should have happened--so why, with that plethora of sourcing, is the author settling for three lousy websites? No, this is not OK. Drmies (talk) 22:42, 21 June 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset, I had a look at what seems to be a very, very cursory review of St. Nikolaus von Flüe, Wörsdorf.

Suggesting "oldest hotel", because "thought to be" already conveys that it's a good guess, but a "oldest known hotel" suggests that there are some "unknown hotels" knocking about. Bogger (talk) 19:35, 4 June 2021 (UTC) @Bogger: The problem with that, is that from my experience, somebody will probably complain at WP:ERRORS that "oldest hotel" is not sufficiently verified when this hits the main page.

Whispyhistory (talk) 12:51, 10 June 2021 (UTC) The source says the Woodenbridge Hotel was founded in 1608 as a coaching inn, which is not quite the same thing, although particularly archaically the term "hotel" has been used for what we might today call a "pub".

Otherwise so far...new enough, no copyvio issues, long enough, QPQ provided. Whispyhistory (talk) 19:12, 10 June 2021 (UTC) Well I'm not a reliable source, but as I understand it, an "inn" is somewhere you stayed overnight as part of an overall journey, while a "hotel" is somewhere you stayed as a temporary accommodation at the end of it. Since you can nowadays drive from Malin to Mizen in a day, this distinction has fallen out of use. As for what to do with the hook and the article, ALT1 : ... that the Royal Hibernian Hotel is thought to be one of the oldest hotels in Ireland? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 21:41, 10 June 2021 (UTC) Sorry for delayed reply. Did they all start as inns? Are these correct: The Royal Hibernian Hotel started in 1751 as a coaching inn [14]. Woodenbridge Hotel was founded in 1608 as an inn. The Glenbeigh Hotel dates back to 1792 when it opened its doors as a Stage Coach Inn [15]? I consider you very reliable btw...but who says it was the first? The source says when they closed, the Royal Hibernian Hotel claimed to be the first hotel in Ireland. If anyone else would like to help, please do. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:39, 11 June 2021 (UTC) There's a transcript of a paper on public dining in Ireland (which the main source used in the article is an extract from) that says "The origin of the Royal Hibernian Hotel, Dawson Street, goes back to 1751, which makes it the oldest known hotel in Ireland (Corr, 1987, p. 5)." I've got no idea what source is "Corr, 1987" but it does mean the claim to be oldest known hotel is a little more verifiable (as opposed to actually true). I think I'm going to need Smirkybec's collection of Irish book sources at this point to progress further. Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 15:52, 11 June 2021 (UTC) Found the paper you mentioned "The origin of the Royal Hibernian Hotel, Dawson Street, goes back to 1751, which makes it the oldest known hotel in Ireland" [16]. You could add to the article as a source. What is "known hotel"? Does that mean the Woodenbridge Hotel was the first unknown hotel? Let me know what you find.

Nominated by Gerda Arendt (talk) at 21:29, 14 June 2021 (UTC). Not a review but a comment, but the hook is trying to mention too many hook facts at once. There's really one very interesting hook fact here (that it was the only theatre in Berlin to survive WW2 without major damage) and the mentions of Kaufmann and Hebbel do not add to the interest and are probably unnecessary for contextual purposes. Maybe the hook should just be something like "... that the Hebbel-Theater (pictured) was the only theatre in Berlin that survived World War II without major damage?" Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:17, 30 June 2021 (UTC) That would work indeed if we had the image (but tomorrow we'll have such a short hook which - without image - will look like about a saint). I thought that educating that it's named after a playwright (whom some may not know) wasn't a bad idea, nor crediting an architect who deserves attention.

Source: van Klinken, Gerry (2006). Colonizing Borneo: State-Building and Ethnicity in Central Kalimantan. KITLV. "The Buntok attack had been launched, the attackers now revealed in a letter, by a movement called Telabang Pantjasila Sektor Dajak. Telabang (or telawang) is a shield; Pantjasila was the Indonesian national ideology, a term that clearly conveyed loyalty to Jakarta. The attackers explained that they had been motivated by grievances, such as their dissatisfaction with government corruption and the cancellation of the marsh drainage scheme. The group added (no doubt with an eye to attracting potential sponsors in Jakarta) that it was ready ???to die for??? Pantjasila. The next day, the group rebaptized itself in even more florid, but slightly less overtly Dayak, terms as Mandau Telabang Pantjasila (mandau refers to a Dayak cutlass). It announced that its leader was Ch. Simbar, alias Mandolin, a Ma???anyan Dayak tribesman. Most importantly, it declared its opposition to the loosely allied anti-Jakarta rebel movements, KRJT, Darul Islam, and the Tentara Islam Indonesia"[1] "The gang allegedly burned houses, raped women, then ran off with gold and diamonds they had robbed from the locals, as well as materials stolen from government offices. The marauders headed north to Kuala Kurung, along the Kahayan River, apparently intent on a repeat performance. They always left leaflets in their wake???this was a modern movement!???promoting the creation of Central Kalimantan province, asserting Dayak commitment to Sukarno, and declaring opposition to an Islamic Indonesia. "[2] "The issue of Central Kalimantan was no doubt on the agenda of an important military meeting set to discuss martial law and regional autonomy in mid-April 1957. Security conditions in the region were now ideal, Tjilik Riwut and the new military commander of Kalimantan declared. Indeed, after having done his part, Simbar had been eased out of the picture. He and Embang came out of the jungle and were taken to meet acting Kalimantan governor, Sarkawie, and his entourage in Banjarmasin in March. Simbar told them he had ???ten thousand??? men committed to him all over Central Kalimantan. The group then travelled together to Buntok and to Bundar to witness four hundred Tentara Lawong members in each place take a symbolic oath of loyalty to the state. The following month, the gang members figured as guests of honor at official celebrations repeated in each of the three regencies that were to join the province. Simbar and Embang???s gangs were rebaptized the Youth Front for the Development of Central Kalimantan; the group was still led by Simbar, who was subsequently counted among the heroes of Central Kalimantan."

The hook is interesting and cited in the article; the source (Allmusic) seems adequate for what it's supporting. QPQ is done. However, the article is currently tagged for overreliance on primary sources - this will need to be resolved before the nomination can continue. I have additional concerns about whether some of the sources used are reliable enough for a BLP, e.g. what makes hardrockhaven.net and soniccathedral.com reliable sources? Citing a statement about her political beliefs to an archive of a now defunct blog seems problematic from a BLP standpoint as well. Needs attention to sourcing before it is promoted to DYK. Spicy (talk) 10:23, 21 June 2021 (UTC) The tag was placed by Kingoflettuce. We discussed this on their talk page and I'm not sure if this was resolved or not. Point taken about the defunct blog for statements from 11 years ago - I'll remove that (which should also help with the SPS concerns). Re: Soniccathedral.com and hardrockhaven.net. Hardrockhaven.net has an editorial staff, and some of its stories have been linked to by reliable publications such as Blabbermouth.net and Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles ([17], [18], [19]). Soniccathedral.com has an editorial staff but unfortunately doesn't have an accessible list.

I'm still unsure about the use of primary sources - quite a lot of the article seems to be based on Q&A interviews like this [24] which don't have any real secondary analysis, and some sources, like this still seem questionable to me. I do realize it's sort of a niche topic and we can't expect a cover story in the New York Times... if it's alright I'd like to relist this for a second opinion by someone more familiar with sourcing expectations in this area.

Jupitus Smart 16:29, 19 June 2021 (UTC) I browsed for sources myself to look for one that wasn't just churnalism ??? recycling a press release or other people's reports. I found a first-hand report which seems to ring true. One point made by this is that these vehicles are custom coach-built and so there's not a standard list price. The price will be individual to each client and RR aren't saying what it is, just as they aren't saying who the clients are. So, it seems difficult to make firm claims based on an unknown variable. As for the street-legal idea, this would need confirmation. Sometimes, high-end cars are not street-legal and so can only be driven on race-tracks or private roads. And even some more mundane cars may not be legal in certain jurisdictions ??? see Illegal Vehicles Banned in America, for example.

Jupitus Smart 18:02, 19 June 2021 (UTC) Listing the various items of bling might make a good hook but we should avoid suggesting that these are standard production items as they are tailored to each client and there's only one example so far. I suggest "the first Rolls-Royce Boat Tail..." As for the issue of price and client confidentiality, you might emphasise this by saying that the rich client and exact price are not being divulged by RR so people are making guesses and estimates.

There's more images to come but from the selection that I've seen, this one was the most striking. Schwede66 02:39, 28 June 2021 (UTC) Hannah Osborne 2018 Christmas Regatta (cropped and lightened) Remarkable image especially in wide! Wonderful get, Schwede66. I???m only a little concerned that the cropped version, particularly in small size, is a little hard to ???read??? because of the darkness. I made a lighter version, but I suppose the rules would require you to use it in the article too... it is certainly technically possible to lighten her in the larger image without losing the beautiful cloud detail but I don???t have those tools at my disposal, we???d need to make a graphics lab request. Before I go any further down this rabbit hole tho: are you still hoping to have this run on the same day as Emma Twigg? Because only one article per set could have an accompanying image anyway. But tell me what you think! Innisfree987 (talk) 05:30, 28 June 2021 (UTC) Great photo indeed, eh? (the photographer has photos of the whole team and we are sending 34 rowers to Tokyo; how good is that?) Happy with having it lightened. I'd be easy about lightening just the crop, but am fine with whatever gets decided. My mate User:Podzemnik is a photo wizard who is active on Commons; maybe he could chip in. With regards to the Twigg nomination, if both run in the same set and I could chose which one to make the lead, I'd go for Osborne because of the stunning photo. But we may be on a 12-hour cycle at the time and they could run in different sets (and only 1 of the 8 can have a photo; I don't have an expectation that my noms get picked for the lead spot).

This one may be especially helpful in conveying what happened and what Gilmore's role in it was. The SABR bio is as well. The long and short of the story is that the Federal League was organized as a minor league but competing in big cities by someone named John T. Powers. It was considered an "outlaw" league because it didn't adhere to the national agreement that kept the other minor leagues subservient to the "major" leagues. The Federal League was struggling financially in 1913, its first season, when some of the executives of the Chicago franchise brought Gilmore into the business. Gilmore brought in some investors and took over control of the team. Later in 1913, the league owners pushed Powers out of the presidency and gave it to Gilmore. With Gilmore, the league owners declared the league to be a major league, and began to lure in stars with big salaries. They signed Joe Tinker and Mordecai Brown, and nearly had Christy Mathewson and some other stars too. They spent too much though, and couldn't sustain it after 1915. I can try to make all of this more clear, especially Gilmore's role in it, in the text. Also, you may have missed it, but QPQ is already done and provided.  Muboshgu (talk) 19:05, 28 June 2021 (UTC) My bad.???Bagumba (talk) 04:42, 30 June 2021 (UTC) I just added this source, which talks about it being a major league.  Muboshgu (talk) 19:13, 28 June 2021 (UTC) @Muboshgu: I suspect it's just a matter of citations or perhaps tweaking prose. I trust your knowledge of the league's history better than mine. Here's what I see as outstanding: For the hook, I'm not seeing the "so" supported in the article for "reorganized the Federal League so that it could challenge Major League Baseball". It's probably true, but needs to be 1) stated in prose that it was the intent 2) cited.???Bagumba (talk) 04:42, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Perhaps not directly DYK related but for general verifiability, I don't see it currently cited about "outlaw". Were there legal consequences? It's not clear from the current citations. Consider copyediting "The owners decided to challenge the American League and National League by declaring themselves to be a major league ..." It's now later stated and cited anout "pitching it as a major league". Otherwise cite or re-word the "declaring themselves" statement. ???Bagumba (talk) 04:42, 30 June 2021 (UTC) I'll start editing on this today. I'll find some more sources that are explicit about it. Here's one that reads: To President Gilmore goes the credit of expanding a bankrupt league to eight cities and enlisting the support of great financial interests. It was the young westerner's rare manipulating genius that made this possible within a period of seven months  Muboshgu (talk) 21:58, 1 July 2021 (UTC) Bagumba, so in addition to the above source, I've added in this edit a 1916 interview in which he explicitly says that he thought there was a need for a third major league. I have also found this 1959 article which credits the reorganization and challenge to the major leagues to Gilmore.  Muboshgu (talk) 01:14, 3 July 2021 (UTC) And I've reworded the "declaration" sentence since I can't find an actual "declaration" per se.  Muboshgu (talk) 01:17, 3 July 2021 (UTC) And as to the point about it being an "outlaw" league, it did go to court, but there wasn't much in terms of repurcussions. Kenesaw Mountain Landis was the judge who had the case, and he sort of punted on it. More is at Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis#Federal_League_and_Baby_Iraene_cases_(1909???1917). It did eventually reach SCOTUS, and Federal Baseball Club v. National League is the case that granted MLB its antitrust exemption.  Muboshgu (talk) 01:21, 3 July 2021 (UTC) @Muboshgu: The inline citations still don't support "outlaw", but it seems verifiable and referred to as such by 3rd party sources, so I'm not concerned anymore about NPOV for the purpose of DYK. The remaining issue is that the article prose still does not support the hook's "so that it could challenge ..." It's probably reasonable to call it supported by The Anaconda Standard, or just reword the hook to "so that it could challenge and challenged ...", listing the events sequentially instead of stating that they were directly related. So either update the prose or hook or combination of both.???Bagumba (talk) 07:24, 4 July 2021 (UTC) @Bagumba: I took another deep dive into newspapers.com and have determined that I had to rewrite the "challenge" aspect. Diff here. The SABR bio itself says In late December 1913, the Federals effectively announced they were for real when they signed Joe Tinker away from the majors on a three-year contract for $36,000, a huge contract for the time. and indeed there was no specific announcement from Gilmore or other other executives.

Take this DYK from June 19: "[Did you know] that the Honolulu Star-Bulletin described Thelma Akana Harrison as 'volatile', 'brilliant', and 'vivacious'"? No context is given as to who Akana Harrison was, what she did, or what led her to be described as such. Her biography was probably little-known even among Hawaii studies scholars. But what was great about that DYK (I would argue most of them) is that they don't presume that the average reader knows about the subject(s) mentioned. Rather, they pique the reader's curiosity, which invite them to click on the link and find out exactly what the subject(s) are/were and why they matter. Therefore, I don't believe that Manceaux's relative obscurity should keep her from being accepted as DYK. Raymonde Linossier didn't really have a "function," certainly not like any that Manceaux later assumed. Linossier was an emerging artist in her own right and had her own needs to attend to. Her "function" in Poulenc's life, such as it was, was to be his steadfast friend. I think it's important to note in the lede her death as it was precisely this event which allowed Manceaux to pursue her destiny, distinct from Linossier, at her uncle's side. There isn't much more to say beyond that, as Miscevic acknowledges in the introduction to his edition of Poulenc's correspondence to Manceaux: "Cependant, ces lettres nous en disent peu sur leur destinataire, dont ne subsiste qu'une dizaine de réponses. Poulenc ne les a-t-il pas conservées? Ont-elles été détruites? Qui était Brigitte elle-même? Une femme restée dans l'ombre, qu'il n'est pas facile de cerner (However, [Poulenc's] letters tell us little about their recipient, of which only a dozen replies are extant. Did Poulenc not keep them? Were they destroyed? Who was Brigitte herself? A woman who remained in the shadows, not easy to pin down)." The first ALT is admittedly awkwardly written, but I think it poignantly encapsulates the intensity of the relationship between Manceaux and Poulenc and why they each needed the other. Therefore, I would rather have a rewrite of that ALT then scrap it. I would appreciate it if you could fix any grammatical or stylistic issues within the article itself. I must confess, I'm great at proofreading other people's writing, but terrible at doing the same with my own. Even after scanning my own text a hundred times, there will always be some detail or other which I careless with. So an extra pair of eyes, as it were, would be very helpful and appreciated. Infobox is fine. The only reason I typically leave them out is because I had the (mistaken?) impression that usage thereof was frowned upon, at least for articles relating to figures in classical music. Personally, I have no problem with them, one way or the other. Let me know what you think! ???CurryTime7-24 (talk) 20:11, 22 June 2021 (UTC) Regarding the first: of course she should have a DYK, but to say unknown person's niece and friends wouldn't make me click. I'd add at least that Poulenc was a composer. If you want to keep Linossier in the lead, please write at least a stub of an article. If you want to try rephrasing the original, go ahead but please don't tell us that her death brought her consolation. "solace" might be a word to consider. Editors decide whether to have an infobox. Don't try one for Poulenc ;) --Gerda Arendt (talk) 20:27, 22 June 2021 (UTC) Gerda Arendt, I'd be delighted if you could add the infobox to the article. I have no objections to that! :) As for your other points, I believe they are fair. The Linossier article will have to wait a little bit as I have a busy workload this week. More than a stub, I had planned to write a full article about her (with corresponding DYK), but won't have time to do so until this weekend. If you could wait a little bit for that, I'd appreciate it. One minor quibble. Understand that I wasn't trying to tell the reader anything other than what Manceaux herself said (at least according to Marcel Schneider). Also, she didn't say or intend to say that death itself "brought her" any "consolation" in the sense that it "arrived as a friend." Rather, she was attempting to find a silver lining in this most terrible of situations; that if there was any good thing about her dying young, at least she hoped it would allow her to be reunited with her beloved uncle who had preceded her by less than three months. That is why I quoted "only consolation" so as to convey to the reader that the sentiment is not mine, but hers. ???CurryTime7-24 (talk) 21:46, 22 June 2021 (UTC) All fine, especially waiting a bit. The quotation of "only consolation" is also fine, but the hook says that her death brought her that consolation, and I struck it as not working. Take your time. I'm not yet convinced that a hook beginning with a woman's deathbed is the best idea. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 22:23, 22 June 2021 (UTC) Sounds good. Now is your objection to Manceaux???s deathbed quote predicated on Wikipedia policy or is this your personal preference? I only ask because earlier this month we had this DYK: ???Did you know that Kid Canfield is the first known person to die live on radio???? ???CurryTime7-24 (talk) 02:45, 23 June 2021 (UTC) I prefer DYK about a subject's life achievements to a deathbed quote, and I am no friend of hooks defining a woman by her relation (whatever kind) to a man (alone). However, I already agreed that your preference may be different. Just please word it correctly, which I feel is tough because we have the translation problem on top of the quotation problem. You can't say "consolation which her death her brought her", implying that death brought her consolation, and I thought I said so. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:52, 23 June 2021 (UTC) Good morning from Southern California, Gerda Arendt! Thanks again for your reply. I feel we're at an impasse here. As the quote from Miscevic intimated, there is little about Manceaux extant which tells us anything about her, much less about any of her own potentially notable achievements. However valid your points certainly are, what you seem to be looking for in Manceaux does not exist. Whereas Linossier was notable in her own right, Manceaux seems to have willingly, even gladly subsumed her own life into her uncle's, whether we agree with that decision or not, whether we feel we must take Poulenc to task or not for making use of his niece this way. Moreover, a DYK which focuses on her own personal achievements (which ones?) I feel doesn't have the eye-grabbing appeal one using her deathbed quote???which I'll say for the third time most urgently and immediately captures who she was and why she matters???most certainly has. Returning to Kid Canfield, the only reason I clicked on that DYK from earlier this month was the admittedly lurid quality of the ALT used. First man to die on live radio? Whoa! But upon clicking the link, I found that his life was not merely defined by this rather gonzo fact. He had a fascinating personal history with underworld types, a gambling career that sounded like something out of The Sting, and finally an improbable conversion to the good life. However, I would've never known about any of that had I not seen that tantalizing DYK. That's my point and that's why I prefer a rewording of the original ALT over something blander. Just to be clear, her sex makes no difference to me; had their roles been reversed, I would just as enthusiastically be pushing for a deathbed quote from Poulenc about Manceaux. ???CurryTime7-24 (talk) 17:36, 23 June 2021 (UTC) go ahead, - just returning from good time outside --Gerda Arendt (talk) 18:24, 23 June 2021 (UTC) Comment I hate to be that guy: it is only by clicking the link that I realized I had (barely) heard of Poulenc before in my life. Could we find a more interesting hook than "she was the best friend and niece of this person you might have heard of"? How about that she was the only person to know of Poluenc (whom you could introduce as "pianist") having a natural daughter? Dahn (talk) 20:34, 24 June 2021 (UTC) I agree, a juicier hook is needed. Please give me a few hours to take care of some work and I'll devise two more which, hopefully, are more engaging. Thanks for your helpful input, Dahn!

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:47, 9 July 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: Sure. My best attempt: ALT 2: ... that pianist Francis Poulenc only told his friend Brigitte Manceaux about his goddaughter being in reality his biological daughter? Dahn (talk) 07:17, 9 July 2021 (UTC) You will need a different reviewer for something purely sensational. I just saw Dialogues des Carmélites last night: he was a great composer, and saying pianist and biological daughter isn't what I'd want to proclaim about him. Add "composer" (and perhaps "confidant") to the original hook, and I'll approve. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:46, 9 July 2021 (UTC) Hi @Gerda Arendt:! The hook I suggested is just that, a suggestion, based on the few tidbits in the article that could constitute a hook; you guys are free to rework it or reject it. Dahn (talk) 15:07, 9 July 2021 (UTC) I don't think the hook is sensational. For one thing, the subject has been deceased for almost 60 years so BLP surely doesn't apply. Secondly, ALT1 simply does not work unless you know who Poulenc is, whereas ALT2 doesn't have that issue. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 03:03, 10 July 2021 (UTC) As for the hook, ALT2 works, the only issue is that the sentence talking about it ( He also disclosed that his godchild, Marie-Ange Lebedeff, born on 13 September 1946, was in actuality his daughter that he had fathered out of wedlock with a friend, Fréderique Lebedeff.) lacks a footnote at the end, when one is required per DYK rules. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 03:05, 10 July 2021 (UTC) I didn't say ALT2 is impossible, I only said that it is impossible for me to approve it. BLP or not is of no consequence for that. You will perhaps find someone to approve it although it says practically nothing about the woman, much more about the man. I believe we could say that he trusted her, telling her personal secrets he shared with no one else, without mentioning such secret. I also see no problem in saying "composer" rather than pianist. Please read the FA. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:21, 10 July 2021 (UTC) Just waiting for Curry's response. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 03:03, 11 July 2021 (UTC) Sorry for the delay.

The page currently seems too light on details of the breed's characteristics, saying that it was "similar to the Harrier", without saying what that means. (To me, a harrier means an aircraft, bird or runner). I suggest adding a closeup picture such as this and some corresponding prose about the breed's coloration and other characteristics. Hook eligibility: Cited: Y Interesting: Y Other problems: N - I'm focussing on the primary hook as ALT1 seems less interesting. The word "old" doesn't seem quite right as Anne only lived to age 49. The real problem was ill-health and obesity so I suggest replacing "old" with "infirm". I'll insert this as ALT2 for clarity. The word (pictured) has been added in this and a capital letter changed.

Unfortunately, the recently deceased COL Hancock [41] makes the only attempt at describing these hounds that I can find, and as said in the article he only says they were smaller and lighter than Staghounds and were similar to Harriers in appearance (personally I suspect the hounds of Edward III were very different from those of Victoria), I feel any commentary from a picture would be OR, if that is insufficient for DYK then so be it.

Although it lost large amounts of people, in comparison to most other regions it had come out relatively unscathed; only losing a quarter of its' existing population compared to a much larger population decrease in the rest of Europe." ALT1 is better but still, estimates of loosing a quarter of population are not 'mostly unaffected'. Can you propose a more moderate hook, something like "one of the least affected in Europe", perhaps? PS.

Thriley (talk) 22:49, 6 July 2021 (UTC) Extended discussion of article title The source you use refers to the archaic human as Homo longi first: 'The extraordinary fossil has been named a new human species, Homo longi or ???Dragon man???'. Ichthyovenator (talk) 07:34, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Why does that matter? The species name doesn't need to be used in the hook. "Dragon Man" is a much more interesting and hook-y name to use from the source. SilverserenC 07:37, 4 July 2021 (UTC) The species name does not need to be used in the hook, no, but 'Dragon Man' is a media nickname that is a direct translation of the species name, not something that fulfills WP:COMMONNAME. We would use Tyrannosaurus or Tyrannosaurus rex, not "T-rex", and Thalattoarchon, not 'T. Rex of the Seas'. At the very least, Dragon Man should be in quotes - ???Dragon Man??? or 'Dragon Man' - as it is in the source used here. Ichthyovenator (talk) 07:46, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Comment: The WP:COMMONNAME is Dragon Man and there is no agreed upon scientific binomial name for the species in the scientific community. Homo longi has not been accepted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and it has not been accepted by the scientific community at large. In fact, there is dispute that Dragon Man might be a previously discovered species, it is still unclear. More scientific work including DNA testing will be required over the next several years. Blockhouse321 (talk) 10:43, 4 July 2021 (UTC) These are the same things Blockhouse321 has been saying in the discussions on the talk page of the relevant article.

Ichthyovenator (talk) 11:11, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Sorry, but never refuted, you have only supported that my position and the general consensus of the scientific community is correct, i.e. no new species, no new binomial scientific name Homo longi; therefore, we default to the WP:COMMONNAME...Dragon Man. Blockhouse321 (talk) 12:41, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Perhaps it would be best to hold off on the article appearing on DYK until the title dispute is resolved. I do not think it is necessary to continue discussing this here rather than in the previous two discussions, but just to make myself clear, you have not demonstrated how 'Dragon Man' is the WP:COMMONNAME. I asked you about this at least twice in the discussions on the talk page but you never responded to me there. You have not demonstrated that Homo longi is not a valid species either, and several editors have refuted that. Ichthyovenator (talk) 15:01, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Dragon Man is what is likely to be the name readers use to look up the article. It is the name used in the popular press: Science], New York Times, BBC.

The disambiguation page should be the main page for Dragon man. I'll go and correct that now. SilverserenC 17:44, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Silver! Thriley (talk) 19:08, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Note how all three also include Homo longi and put 'Dragon Man' in quotes and/or refer to it as a nickname. More readers probably search for 'T-Rex' than Tyrannosaurus, that doesn't mean that 'T-Rex' should be the title. Ichthyovenator (talk) 19:57, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Why does this have anything to do with the DYK nomination? If you are suggesting a name move request, do that on the article talk page. It has nothing to do with this nomination. SilverserenC 20:02, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Why is it okay for Thriley to use the argument "Dragon Man is what is likely to be the name readers use to look up the article" but not okay for me to counter with "More readers probably search for 'T-Rex' than Tyrannosaurus, that doesn't mean that 'T-Rex' should be the title"?? T-Rex should not be an article title, nor should it be the name used in a DYK. Ichthyovenator (talk) 07:54, 5 July 2021 (UTC) 'T-Rex' would be perfectly acceptable in a DYK. Article titles are often changed for brevity and/or appeal to the reader. Thriley (talk) 14:01, 5 July 2021 (UTC) Would it be? In any case, as I stated previously, I would be fine with 'Dragon Man' as long as it is in quotes since the sources cited all put it in quotes, designating it as an informal nickname. I don't see why Wikipedia shouldn't follow suit on that point. Ichthyovenator (talk) 19:56, 5 July 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Title should be Homo longi, everything else is simply an error. Jens Lallensack (talk) 20:26, 4 July 2021 (UTC) You don't "oppose" DYK nominations and the title of the article has nothing to do with the DYK nomination. Again, if you want the article title changed, go to the article talk page and start a name move request. All of you need to stop misusing this DYK nomination page for an article talk page discussion. SilverserenC 20:31, 4 July 2021 (UTC) A DYK should obviously be free of errors (this is why there is this review). With this important issue, the article is clearly not ready. My oppose still stands. Jens Lallensack (talk) 20:39, 4 July 2021 (UTC) There are no errors in the nomination, a reliable sourced used nickname is allowed to be used in a nomination hook. Furthermore, if you disagree with a hook, then you instead should suggest an alt hook. Again, you don't "oppose" a DYK nomination, that's not how this works. SilverserenC 20:49, 4 July 2021 (UTC) "Dragon man" is the specimen (the individual skull), not the species. You got the definition of your article wrong. Articles with such issues won't be shown on the main page, simply put. Jens Lallensack (talk) 20:57, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Comment I found the problem. This nomination is being transcluded onto the talk page, where a name change debate is going on and people are confusing this with that discussion. I'm going to delete the transclusion to prevent this from continuing. SilverserenC 20:32, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Comment: on the article talk page, the Administrator has determined that there is no consensus for the naming of the article, so the name of the article remains Dragon Man and not Homo longi.

Source: [73] Reviewed: Allen Mawer Created by Flibirigit (talk). Self-nominated at 02:44, 27 June 2021 (UTC). General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy: Article is sourced, neutral, and free of copyright problems Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: Y Interesting: Y Other problems: N - Hook is unclear/misleading. The context of the "free ride" statement is that when Mary Dunn was on the University of Manitoba Bison women's hockey team, the team practiced with "Andy Blair and other members of the Bison men's hockey team. She recalled in a 1938 interview that the men did not hesitate to use physical contact and she 'got many a free ride' on the ice." Getting a "free ride" sounds to me like the men treated the women players easily which contradicts the idea of the men not hesitating to use physical contact. This is not explained in the article. However, the cited source does clarify it, saying, "Mrs. Jimmie Dunn remembers the time when Varsity girls' hockey team practised with such players as Andy Blair and his contemporaries. If a girl got in their way they would just lift her up and dump her elsewhere. Mrs. Dunn got many a free ride." [74] In other words, the "free ride" was from one part of the ice to wherever the other player put her. I would prefer to use a hook which is clear and not misleading on its own without having to refer to the underlying source to figure out what the hook even means. QPQ: Done. Overall: With a better hook, I would be fine with seeing this article at DYK. Metropolitan90 (talk) 03:25, 27 June 2021 (UTC) I am completely baffled and have no idea what the reviewer is trying to say. I fail to see what is unclear or misleading. If anyone knows how to fix the infobox image it would be greatly appreciated, since I cannot figure that out either. Flibirigit (talk) 14:12, 27 June 2021 (UTC) I have inquired at Wikipedia:Help desk for help with the image and asked a couple smarter editors to assist with the hook. Flibirigit (talk) 14:41, 27 June 2021 (UTC) The file was listed as 0×0 pixels so it wasn't displaying properly. I reuploaded it and it seems to be okay now. I also moved the fair use rationale to the licensing. The file page could use a description of the image in the summary section. ??? Reidgreg (talk) 16:57, 27 June 2021 (UTC) In ice hockey, is it common to refer to someone being lifted up by an opponent and placed somewhere else on the ice as "getting a free ride"? If it is, then I would be willing to withdraw my objection. But I can't find evidence of that. By contrast, see this New York Times article where "getting a free ride" implies being treated easily without being checked. --Metropolitan90 (talk) 15:18, 27 June 2021 (UTC) I think the quote "got many a free ride" is unclear in both the hook and the article (as compared to the source). We generally don't want the hooks to be confusing or misleading (outside of April Fools). It's unclear (a) what "free ride" means and (b) whether "got many" means that Dunn 'received many free rides' or 'gave free rides to many (others)'. In the context of university athletics, I thought a "free ride" meant a full scholarship, and that she somehow arranged these for many athletic students. Others might think this has something to do with a heavy check (ice hockey), that she was a very physical player who sent others flying. What the source means is that she was often picked up and carried by opposing male players during practices. In the 1930s, "free ride" was probably much more associated with transportation (migratory populations, hobos and such). The article should make this clear (the meaning, not the bit about hobos) and I feel an alternative phrasing for the hook is warranted. I also feel there could be another hook about her accomplishments as a sports organizer. ??? Reidgreg (talk) 15:47, 27 June 2021 (UTC) The following are some ALTs. ???

Flibirigit (talk) 15:50, 4 July 2021 (UTC) I have contemplated this for a while and feel it is best to remove all instances of "free ride" and to consider other hooks. I appreciate the remainining hooks proposed, but have struck the word "often" from the hockey hooks since the cited source does not say it happened often, just that it happened.

There is no structural or historical discrimination towards heterosexuality, and heterosexuals are not attacked or harassed with the term paqui; it is rather a humorous, shared code between LGBT people. I could relate this to the non-existence of "reverse racism" (from blacks to whites) and of the oppression of women towards men. ??????????????????? ???????????????????? ???????????????????? ????
