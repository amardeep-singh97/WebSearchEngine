Wikipedia:NOTBROKEN - Wikipedia Wikipedia:NOTBROKEN From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Wikipedia:Redirect#Do not "fix" links to redirects that are not broken This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space. To a section: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to a section of a page on the subject. For redirects to embedded anchors on a page, use {{R to anchor}} instead. From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace. Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles. Mentioned in a hatnote: This is a redirect from a title that is mentioned in a hatnote at the redirect target. The mention is usually atop the target article. It may, however, be directly under a section header, or in another article's hatnote, (whenever the hatnote is under a section, {{R to section}} should also be used). The titles of redirects mentioned in hatnotes may refer to a subject other than that of the target page. It is possible that this redirect may need to be retargeted, or become an article under its own title, (see {{R with possibilities}}). If the title is a good candidate for a Wiktionary link, it may also be added. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
