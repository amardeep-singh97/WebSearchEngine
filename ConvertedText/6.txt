In Wikipedia, access keys allow you to do a lot more???protect a page, show page history, publish your changes, show preview text, and so on. See the next section for the full list. Most web browsers require holding down one or two "modifier" keys to use an access key. Different web browsers invoke access keys in different ways.

CSS with shortcuts shown on hover Play media Play the video to see how this CSS snippet works. The skin used here is Vector, but this will work for any skin. a:hover[accesskey]:before {
    content: " " attr(accesskey) " ";
    text-transform: uppercase;
    white-space: pre;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    margin-right: 0.5ex;
}
 CSS with shortcuts shown always Adding this code displays the access keys on every Wikipedia page, as shown in this picture. a[accesskey]:before {
    content: " " attr(accesskey) " ";
    text-transform: uppercase;
    white-space: pre;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    margin-right: 0.5ex;
}
 CSS with shortcuts shown always with a box This is identical to the above code except the access keys are displayed with boxes around them. a[accesskey]:before {
    content: " " attr(accesskey) " ";
    text-transform: uppercase;
    white-space: pre;
    border: thin solid;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    text-decoration: underline overline;
    margin-right: 0.5ex;
}
 This will not work in Internet Explorer versions lower than 8.0, since those browsers do not support the CSS selector used in these examples. This also will not display the accesskeys provided by the VisualEditor (or the mw:2017 wikitext editor), such as 's' to publish the page, as those accesskeys are implemented differently.

At the same time, they are bothersome for some screen reader users because it interferes with the shortcuts of their screen reader. The best solution would be to have customizable keyboard shortcuts. The accessibility of keyboard shortcuts (access keys) is a complicated matter. This feature, in its current implementation, was temporarily abandoned in WCAG 2.0, notably because it conflicts with the shortcuts of assistive technologies. Usage of access keys is currently discouraged in the online contents and applications. But presence of access keys is also an Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) requirement???the ATAG approach is particularly relevant in Wikipedia's case???where this matter is looked into thoroughly. In particular, ATAG requires the possibility to customize shortcuts. This should be requested in bugzilla:477. Currently, their presence in Wikipedia's interface can be problematic for some users and can be useful for others. But more importantly, it misleads developers into thinking that the interface is keyboard accessible. Requirements that need to be fulfilled for a website to be keyboard accessible are not related to keyboard shortcuts (G90, F42, SCR35, F58, F61). Known issues: Gadgets which block keyboard shortcuts Gadget wikEd blocks keyboard shortcut on Google Chrome and Firefox.
