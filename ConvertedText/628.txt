Help:Using talk pages - Wikipedia Help:Using talk pages From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Help:Talk pages This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: Semi-protected: This is a redirect from a title that is semi-protected from editing for any of several possible reasons. Please do not replace these redirected links with links directly to the target page unless expressly advised to do so below or elsewhere on this page, or if the change is supported by a policy or guideline. To a help page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of help namespace to a page in that namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside help namespace. For redirects from outside help space, see Category:Redirects to help namespace. From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed) or is the result of a page move. One reason this page was kept as a redirect is to avoid breaking links, both internal and external, that may have been made to the old page name. Any redirect with a page move logged on its history page should be tagged with this rcat template. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
