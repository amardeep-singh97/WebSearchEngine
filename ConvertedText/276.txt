Did You Know defines "prose" to exclude infoboxes, categories, references, lists, tables, block quotes, headers, images and captions, the "See also" section if any, Table of Contents, edit buttons, "citation needed" and similar superscripted text, and reference link numbers like [6]. More details here. C2: Proposed lists need 1,500+ characters of prose as defined above. The listed items themselves are not counted as part of the 1,500 DYK qualifying characters. C3: In practice, articles longer than 1,500 characters may still be rejected as too short, at the discretion of the selecting reviewers and administrators.
