Wikilink - Wikipedia Wikilink From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Redirect page Jump to navigation Jump to search Redirect to: Hyperlink#Wikis This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: With possibilities: This is a redirect from a title that potentially could be expanded into a new article or other type of associated page such as a new template. The topic described by this title may be more detailed than is currently provided on the target page or in a section of that page. {{R printworthy}} should be used together with this template when applied to a redirect in mainspace. When used on a template redirect, it will automatically populate Category:Template redirects with possibilities. When the target page becomes too large, or for any reason a new page would be an improvement, this redirect may be replaced with an article, template or other project page that is carved out of the target page. See also {{R to section}} and use together with this rcat when appropriate. If the topic of the redirect is not susceptible to expansion, then use other rcats such as {{R to section}} or {{R to list entry}} when appropriate. Since a new page may be created, links to this redirect should not be replaced with a direct link to the target page. To a section: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to a section of a page on the subject. For redirects to embedded anchors on a page, use {{R to anchor}} instead. From a subtopic: This is a redirect from a subtopic of the target article. If the redirected subtopic could potentially have its own article in the future, then also use {{R with possibilities}} and {{R printworthy}}. If notability of the subject can be shown, then be bold and convert this redirect into an article on the subtopic. From a printworthy page title: This is a redirect from a title that would be helpful in a printed or CD/DVD version of Wikipedia. See Wikipedia:Printability for more helpful information. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
