But when the hook is written, the hook fact must be cited in the article with an inline citation, since inline citations are used to support specific statements in an article. The hook fact must have an inline citation right after it since the fact is an extraordinary claim; citing the hook fact at the end of the paragraph is not acceptable. Once again, that rule is only for the hook fact, not for every sentence in the article. (Yes, we know featured articles don't have that rule, but that's because featured articles don't have hook facts.) D2: The article in general should use inline citations of reliable sources. A rule of thumb is one inline citation per paragraph, excluding the intro, plot summaries, and paragraphs which summarize other cited content. Newly sourced BLPs are expected to be thoroughly sourced. D3: Sources should be properly labelled; that is, not under an "External links" header. References in the article must not be bare URLs according to Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 29#Reference section. D4: Wikipedia, including Wikipedias in other languages, is not considered a Wikipedia:Reliable source. D5: Multiple sources are generally required, to ensure the article meets the general notability guideline.
