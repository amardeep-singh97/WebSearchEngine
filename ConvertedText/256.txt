Please read the protection policy for details. Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to high-risk templates; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the rough guide to semi-protection); and move protection is used to stop page-move wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the rough guide to extended confirmed protection) After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on Special:Protectedpages. Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of obvious vandalism. Skip to table of contents requests to raise protection lower protection requested edits rolling archive (up to 7 days) (purge) Instructions If you would like to request to have a page protected, have a page's existing protection level lowered or raised, or would like to submit an edit request for a protected page, please follow these steps (note: if you enable the Twinkle gadget for your Wikipedia account, this process can be largely automated for you): If you are requesting unprotection, the correct protocol is to ask the protecting administrator first for unprotection (the admin's user account name can be found in the page's edit history). If for any reason he or she is unresponsive, unwilling, or unable to lower protection then you may list your request on this page. Add a level-3 header (i.e. === [[Example title]] ===) with the exact title of the page you would like (un)protected. If the page is not in the article namespace, include the namespace prefix (e.g. Template:Example template or User:Example user). Place your request at the bottom of either the protection or unprotection list, depending on the nature of your request. Please make sure you have spelled the name of the article properly; a common error stems from mistaken requests for the protection of redirects, particularly capitalised ones (Twinkle can make sure this never happens to you!) Place the pagelinks template below the header, in the form of * {{pagelinks|Example title}} (note the asterisk). If you are requesting protection, write the type of request (full protection, semi-protection, pending changes, move protection) and a brief reason for your request below your header. Please do not add arbitrary requests for a protection expiry time to your request, or request indefinite protection arbitrarily. If there is a reason for a page to be protected for a certain amount of time, such as protecting a user talk page until the user is unblocked, please make this clear. If you are requesting indefinite semi-protection or pending changes, be aware that it is only applied to articles with endemic and endless vandalism problems that multiple increasing periods of temporary semi-protection or pending changes have failed to stop. Note that different expiry times can be set for edit- and for move-protections??? thus, an article can, for example, be semi-edit-protected for a week and also fully-move-protected indefinitely. Sign your request with four tildes ~~~~ and click Publish changes. Note: editors should not consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content. If a request contains excessive argument, appears to be intended to resolve a content dispute, includes personal attacks or uncivil comments, or has any other unrelated discussion, it will be removed from this page and no action will be taken. Examples For single page requests === [[Example Article Name]] ===
* {{pagelinks|Example Article Name}}
'''Semi-protection:''' High level of IP vandalism. ~~~~ === [[Template:Example Template Name]] ===
* {{pagelinks|Template:Example Template Name}}
'''Reduction in protection level:''' From full protection to template editor protection. ~~~~ For multiple page requests with the same criteria === Short descriptive header ===
* {{pagelinks|Wikipedia:Example Page Name 1}}
* {{pagelinks|Wikipedia:Example Page Name 2}}

There is a large mass who may baffle the article who are dis-satisfied with this decision. Many of them have come to street of the capital city at present within few hours. I sure they may attack this article as well. To prevent any possible vandalism, I request protection on this article as soon as possible. 110.44.124.154 (talk) 08:31, 12 July 2021 (UTC) Current requests for reduction in protection level[edit] Shortcuts WP:RFUP WP:RFPU Before posting, first discuss with the protecting admin at their talk page. Only post below if you receive no (favourable) reply. To find out the username of the admin who protected the page click on "history" at the top of the page, then click on "View logs for this page" which is under the title of the page. The protecting admin is the username in blue before the words "protected", "changed protection level" or "pending changes". If there are a number of entries on the log page, you might find it easier to select "Protection log" or "Pending changes log" from the dropdown menu in the blue box. Requests to downgrade full protection to template protection on templates and modules can be directed straight here; you do not need to ask the protecting admin first. Requests for removing create protection on redlinked articles are generally assisted by having a draft version of the intended article prepared beforehand. If you want to make spelling corrections or add uncontroversial information to a protected page please add {{Edit fully-protected}} to the article's talk page, along with an explanation of what you want to add to the page. If the talk page is protected please use the section below. Check the rolling archive if you cannot find your request. Only recently answered requests are still listed here. Current requests for edits to a protected page[edit] Shortcut WP:RFED Ideally, requests should be made on the article talk page rather than here. Unless the talk page itself is protected, you may instead add the appropriate template among {{Edit protected}}, {{Edit template-protected}}, {{Edit extended-protected}}, or {{Edit semi-protected}} to the article's talk page if you would like to make a change rather than requesting it here. Doing so will automatically place the page in the appropriate category for the request to be reviewed. Where requests are made due to the editor having a conflict of interest (COI; see Wikipedia:Suggestions for COI compliance), the {{request edit}} template should be used. Requests to move move-protected pages should be made at Wikipedia:Requested moves, not here. If the discussion page and the article are both protected preventing you from making an edit request, this page is the right place to make that request. Please see the top of this page for instructions on how to post requests. This page is not for continuing or starting discussions regarding content should both an article and its discussion page be protected. Please make a request only if you have a specific edit you wish to make. Further information: Wikipedia:Edit requests Create a level 3 header with a link to the article in question, then a {{pagelinks}} template and then the reason. Handled requests[edit] A rolling archive of the last seven days of protection requests can be found at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection/Rolling archive.
