Wikipedia co-founder on WP's flaws ??? and potential replacement? (SMcCandlish, 2 June 2018) Update: Larry Sanger, who helped start Wikipedia (as Nupedia in 2000) but left the project in 2002, has elaborated quite a bit on his earlier examination of WP's flaws. They're laid out, as background material, in an April 2018 announcement of a blockchain-based encyclopedia project, provisionally named Everipedia, which would subsume WP's own content as well as introduce lots more. Read the detailed whitepaper version or the short summary version ??? or both, since they're not 100% consistent. This is an idea that could actually grow legs (even accounting for all the blockchain hype that's going around). The idea is to open-source online encyclopedia writing even further, with a real-value reward structure, expert and public review, directly competing articles in a marketplace of content, and the writing/publishing process decoupled from the centralized control of a single community and its rules. The primary question to my mind is: How could quality be ensured, if no particular policies applied? A truly unfettered marketplace of ideas and "information" produces populist, falsehood-mired dreck (e.g., fake news, everything you see on 4Chan and Facebook, the History Channel converting into an aliens and ghosts conspiracy network, and that planet-sized morass of bullshit we call the blogosphere, as just a few obvious examples). Still, I'm curious where this is supposed to be heading. And, since there's to be a compensation mechanism, do I get paid out by Everipedia's blockchain for my 100,000+ WP edits here when they get imported into Everipedia, or does some script kiddie cash in on more than a decade of my work when she runs a few lines of code to copy a zillion WP articles into the new system? Kinda matters. Also: calling it anything-pedia is likely to fail; that namespace is already glutted.?????????SMcCandlish ??? ¢?????????? 01:50, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Original 11 November 2015 story ("Wikipedia's Co-founder Is Its Biggest Critic", Zach Schwartz, Vice magazine): Sanger said in a [then-]recent interview, "I think Wikipedia never solved the problem of how to organize itself in a way that didn't lead to mob rule", and that since he left the project, "People that I would say are trolls sort of took over. The inmates started running the asylum." Not an idle concern? ?????????SMcCandlish ??? ??? ¢????????????????????? 09:07, 19 November 2015??? (UTC) [Comments?] Study confirms what we knew already: People edit here to change public perception (Barbara Page, "Edit-a-thon participants are motivated by desire to change the views of society", The Signpost, 24 May, 2018) An Information Research survey shows that people's editing motivation is often "their desire to change the views of society", and also that they view Wikipedia as a "social media site". This isn't news to us, and the material doesn't have a huge statistical sample, but I would bet real money that it will be re-confirmed by later studies. This has systemic bias, neutrality, and conflict of interest implications (also not news). What we don't really think much about it is what this means for Wikipedia long-term, as everyone with an agenda becomes more aware that they can try to sneakily leverage Wikipedia articles to boost their side of any story, especially after the Trump 2016 US presidential campaign proved that great/terrible things can pulled off by organized manipulation of "social media" sites (whether WP really is one or not is irrelevant if the public thinks it is). ?????????SMcCandlish ??? ¢?????????? 23:28, 1 June 2018 (UTC) [Comments?] WMF Community Wishlist Survey is system-gameable (SMcCandlish, 19 December 2017) The 2017 Community Wishlist Survey has closed; the results are here, and as disappointing as in previous years. This process is fundamentally flawed, for numerous reasons: Only the top-ten proposals will get any resources devoted to them, no matter how many there are, or how urgent or important they are. It's a straight-vote, canvassing-allowed, no-rationale-needed, short-term "popularity contest" ??? normal Wikimedian consensus-building is thwarted. This setup encourages people to vote for the 10 things they want most, then vote against every other proposal even if they agree with it. Proposals cannot build support over time. There's no "leveling of the playing field" between categories. Important proposals of narrower interest (e.g. to admins, or to technical people) never pass, only the lowest-common-denominator ones do ??? and the most-canvassed ones. Too few Wikimedians even know the survey exists or when it is open, which greatly compounds the skew caused by focused canvassing ??? the intentional spikes actually determine the outcome. I've drafted some suggestions for making it work better. ?????????SMcCandlish ??? ¢???>?????????<??? 18:08, 19 December 2017 (UTC) [Comments?] "Time Inc. Buyer Helped Koch Brothers Airbrush Their Image Across the Internet" (Lee Fang, The Intercept, 1 December 2017) Far-right billionaire investors the Koch brothers ??? who have a long history of media manipulation ??? have been using sockpuppets (via an intermediary PR firm, Meredith Corporation, to whitewash on Wikipedia. Koch, through Meredith, is now buying out Time Inc., publisher of Time magazine and other major publications. This may ultimately impact the reliability (or perception of reliability) of them as sources. ?????????SMcCandlish ??? ¢???>?????????<??? 03:02, 4 December 2017 (UTC) [Comments?] New "Wikipedia:Nations and Wikipedia" page (Fixuture, Wikipedia:Village pump (policy), 26 June 2017) "Wikipedia:Nations and Wikipedia" is a new meta page to accumulate and help organize ways nations/governments and Wikipedia interact and for the Wikipedia community to establish relevant policies and guidelines." This may be a good place to keep track of evidence of organized tampering with Wikipedia content by governments and those doing their bidding (see Pakistan article, below). Or at least a place to formulate a community response to this problem. ?????????SMcCandlish ??? ??? ¢????????????????????? 03:57, 29 June 2017 (UTC) [Comments?] "Inside the game of sports vandalism on Wikipedia" (Jeff Elder, Wikimedia Blog, 6 January, 2016) This is just one example in a years-long pattern of various forms of sport vandalism (i.e. vandalism for sport), which just happens to be about sports. This kind of spontaneous mob behavior is a different wrinkle on the "traditional" sort of mass vandalism, e.g. some celebrity encouraging (often as a joke) their fans to go do disinformational things here. This particular sort isn't even new. What I find more interesting is the rapidity and spread of the mainstream-press coverage of this non-event, which was already dealt with on WP before even online editions of any newspapers could run their stories. Over 1,500 ran them anyway, even though they were reporting on already-resolved trivia. This tells us that, while the press will sometimes grudgingly report good things about WP, they all feel threatened by it and will continue to make it look bad to their circulation if they can get away with it. This means we need to not treat as inconsequential any real-world perceptions of problems with or on WP, because they will probably be called out publicly and exaggerated. ?????????SMcCandlish ??? ??? ¢????????????????????? 21:05, 10 February 2016 (UTC) [Comments?] Archived stories: RfC to require paid editors' disclosure of advertising to edit (Doc James, and 100+ Wikimedian respondents, Meta.Wikimedia.org, 13 September 2017 ???

(Gamaliel, Wikipedia Signpost, 18 February 2015) Hi![edit] I am Stanton McCandlish (often referred to as just SMcC here and some have nicknamed me Mac, which I don't mind). I am a Web developer, IT consultant, nonfiction author, civil liberties activist and nonprofit executive, as well as amateur pocket billiards (pool) instructor, former online news editor, policy analyst, archivist, independent publisher, and also an amateur artist, among other things. I have been among the most active, avid Wikipedians. I have a B.A. in anthropology and communication (a custom minor that combines linguistics and broader human communication, including journalism, PR, and media criticism). I am a US citizen, but have lived in England, Ireland, and Canada for extended periods, and learned to read and write in the UK (and I use something of a form of Mid-Atlantic English consequently). I have competence in an odd assortment of topics, like Celtic mythology, English grammar and usage, Manx cats, New Mexican culture, US law in certain fields (freedom of expression, privacy, and intellectual property), salamanders, Web standards, UI usability, albinism, pool and billiards, online media, Art Nouveau, post-punk subcultures, Mac OS X, and various fiction franchises (though about 95% of my reading time is non-fiction), among other subjects. Being an autodidactic polymath, my interests shift over time and are intense. My latest passions are the interface of zoology and anthropology, especially the history and nature of domestication; and shifting patterns of English usage.

Bio[edit] Basically, this is my highly compressed CV Stanton McCandlish is a freelance web developer, systems and network administrator, and online PR/communications consultant; a buyer and seller of collectibles; and a pool instructor. His specialties include advocacy, media relations, information management and architecture, usability, technology policy analysis, and technical writing. His educational background is primarily in cultural anthropology and linguistics. He was for a while the technology VP and lead developer of a Toronto-based consulting firm. He was previously employed, and later volunteered, as the communications director for the CryptoRights Foundation. As such, he acted as the nonprofit's press and public-relations lead, publications manager, and webmaster, and also participated in mission-critical technical projects. Stanton was among the world's first professional online activists, and came to CryptoRights after working on issue campaigns, policy, and online communications at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) during its most formative and influential era, from 1993 to 2002, where he also ran one of the most-linked-to websites on the entire Internet, and edited the organization's newsletter, EFFector, one of the largest-subscription online bulletins of the era. He has written a variety of articles and tutorials, been quoted by most major US news publications on Internet policy issues, and is co-author of the privacy and e-activism book Protecting Yourself Online: The Definitive Resource on Safety, Freedom, and Privacy in Cyberspace (with Robert B. Gelman). He also managed production of the updated online editions of Everybody's Guide to the Internet (by Adam Gaffin), including revision, management of multi-language translation, and online distribution. After studying computer science, technical writing, and anthropology/linguistics at the College of Santa Fe, Eastern New Mexico University, and the University of New Mexico, McCandlish worked as a technical consultant at UNM, while maintaining an early independent electronic bulletin board system (BBS) and operating a small-press publishing operation in Albuquerque. Some of his current areas of (mostly off-WP) interest include electronic privacy, free expression online, preservation of fair use of intellectual property, and protection of the public's interest in the development of technical standards. McCandlish holds a BA in cultural anthropology and communication from UNM. He likes cats, salamanders, spicy food, art nouveau, post-punk, good girl art, and Skyrim. He lives in Oakland, California.

I devote most of my mainspace time to improving poor articles to be encyclopedic quality, rather than "polishing the chrome" on already-good articles. Both kinds of work are necessary, but I find working on Stub, Start, and C-class articles, to move them toward B, A, and Good class, is a higher priority for the project. (To date, I have little interest in Good-to-Featured improvement; that's a wiki-subculture all its own.) Stats on the articles I have edited the most ACUI Collegiate Pocket Billiards National Championship ??? created article, as a 5-source stub verging on Start-class Albinism ??? Was already a not-bad article when I got there, but I worked on it a lot, especially sourcing the science, and defending it from frequent vandalism. Most of my work on it has been surpassed by now, but it was important back in the day (late 2000s). Albinism in popular culture ??? Was a narrow AfD survivor in the form of Albino bias and an AfD failure as Evil albino stereotype when I got to them; it's quite solid now, after a lot of mergin' & purgin', reliable sourcing, and frequent shepherding and cleanup. Antebellum architecture (mostly based on material split from Antebellum period) Blackball (pool) ??? Mostly my work, building on skeletal, unsourced material originally interpolated into Eight-ball. Help wanted! Caffè d'orzo Crystalate Manufacturing Company, an early plastics manufacturer English in New Mexico ??? along with several others, have been working to develop this into a proper article (it's more difficult than it sounds; most of the source material is on paper at the UNM library, or behind journal-archive paywalls) Five-pins ??? Article about the carom billiards game popular in Italy and parts of South America. I wrote it from scratch after someone posted a (terrible) machine-translation of the (good) Italian article; mine is now more extensive than the original Italian one, though may yet suffer from translation problems. Help wanted from someone fluent in Italian. Folgerphone ??? an experimental musical instrument. Someone's disputed a major fact, on the Talk page. Help wanted from anyone who knows anything at all about Folgerphones. Galfrid, a major disambiguation page (it existed before but had very little in it); this took a considerable amount of work, hunting down all the notable and probably-notable Galfrids (many of whom were also Geoffreys, Godfrieds, Gruffydds, Goffredos, etc., and not at titles with "Galfrid" or "Galfridus" in them), and looking into the origin of the name and its variants, and their relation to other names. Ground billiards ??? written from scratch IBSF World Snooker Championship International Open Series, a snooker tournament List of professional sports (mostly based on material split from Professional sports) List of U.S. Open pool championships (begun as a disambiguation page) Logorrhea (psychology) (mostly based on material split from what was Logorrhea (rhetoric) and now at Verbosity) Mythology (fiction) Persian onager, a beast Pleonasm ??? Article on redundant expressions in language. About 70% or so of that text is mine. Relatedly, I also shepherded various other language articles like Verbosity, Redundancy (language) and Calque, until they became stable. Pool Hall Blues, an episode of TV series Quantum Leap Pro???am (mostly based on material split from what is now Amateur professionalism) Sandbox (software development) ??? A coding safety process. Created this article. I crack up when someone mistakes it for the Wikipedia:Sandbox. Shrew (stock character) ??? I did a WP:TNT total rewrite [2] to a B-class article, and wiping out various WP:NPOV and WP:NOR problems Three-ball ??? Article about the poorly-documented modern pocket billiards folk game, about 95% my material. Sourcing help wanted! Turkmenian kulan, a creature Valley-Dynamo, a gaming table manufacturer (especially pool, foosball, and air hockey) Valley National 8-Ball League Association, a pool league (actually international) William A. Spinks ??? written from scratch William Hoskins (inventor) ??? written from scratch Overhauled[edit] Pre-existing pages I've done a lot of work on (over time or all at once); new list started January 2018, so very incomplete: Girls Under Glass ??? band article which I redid top to bottom, from a broken-English list of bullet points into a comprehensive article (with some help from the German Wikipedia page on them). This cleanup and expansion [3] (about 23K more material) saved it from WP:AFD. Godwin's law ??? I informally shepherded this page for quite some time, before other editors got more involved in keeping it encyclopedic. (I have a potential conflict of interest, since I worked at the same organization as its namesake back in the 1990s.) Jeanette H. Lee ??? Korean-American businesswoman article. I originally nominated this for deletion, but after it was kept as (marginally) notable, I significantly worked up the article so it will be properly encyclopedic. Khes ??? iffy article on an Indic fabric type and garment, written by a non-native English speaker, and with poor sourcing. Was already slated for AfD by someone, but I managed to massage it into passable shape (a quality edit more than a quantity one). Still had issues (as of December 2020), but I drew attention to the page at the wikiprojects and noticeboards for India- and Pakistan-related topics. Lynette Horsburgh ??? British amateur cue-sports champion. Was AfDed, so I improved it (diff includes a few intervening edits by someone else), and it was kept. Not a massive overhaul, but a qualitative one. Mora, New Mexico [4]; Mora County, New Mexico [5]; First Battle of Mora [6]; Second Battle of Mora [7] ??? They were palimpsests of confusing drive-by edits, so I re-did them all with everything where it actually pertains, copyedited, and with some new sources. Nithyananda ??? a controversial modern guru of India. For a long time, this article was veering back and forth between a WP:BLP-violating attack page and a shameless promotional advertisement by his followers (whom I attempted to dissuade from further WP policy violations, both on-wiki and by contacting his organization directly). I overhauled it repeatedly, and watchdogged it for months until sufficient attention from other neutral editors was drawn to it. (Problems still arise, but they are much more manageable now.) Wikipedia policies, guidelines, essays, and proposals[edit] Stats on the "Wikipedia:"-namespace pages I have edited the most Wikipedia:Notability ??? policy ??? I was deeply involved in the debate over the future and form of this when it was a proposed guideline, especially from Nov. 2006 through Feb. 2007, until it stabilized (it was much more controversial back then than editors today might realize). Wikipedia:Gaming the system#Gaslighting ??? guideline sub-section ??? I popularized the concept on WP; someone else added it to the guideline, though most of the wording is mine at this point. Wikipedia:Manual of Style, Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers), etc. ??? guidelines ??? Along with many other "regulars", I have spent a lot of time shepherding the MoS, and have written substantial portions of it. I often move on to other stuff, so as to not get overly focused on it, then return to it periodically, mostly to help keep it stable. Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography ??? WP:MOS sub-guideline ??? major 2018 overhaul [8], merging in material from MOS:LEAD, MOS:ABBREV, and MOS:CAPS Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Religions, deities, philosophies, doctrines, and their adherents ??? WP:MOS sub-guideline section ??? principal author Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Cue sports ??? WP:AT/WP:MOS sub-guideline ??? principal author Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Glossaries ??? WP:AT/WP:MOS sub-guideline draft ??? principal author Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Icons ??? WP:MOS sub-guideline ??? one of the principal authors (I wrote most its key provisions) Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Organisms ??? WP:MOS sub-guideline draft ??? principal author Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ice hockey) ??? did a total rewrite (combined diff), so that it makes some kind of sense, and actually follows site-wide policies and guidelines; not sure how much of that will stick. Wikipedia:Naming conventions (sportspeople) ??? WP:AT sub-guideline ??? principal author Wikipedia:WikiProject Cue sports/Notability ??? WP:N sub-guideline draft ??? principal author Wikipedia:Notability (breeds) ??? WP:N sub-guideline draft ??? one of the principal authors Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Naming guidelines ??? WP:AT sub-guideline ??? much of the prose is and most of the structure is my work, though none of the major ideas are; I simply took a palimpsestuous mess and made a parseable document out of it. view talk edit Wikipedia:Advice for hotheads ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Article titles/Criteria order ??? supplement ??? principal author Wikipedia:Asshole John rule ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Commas exist for a reason ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Common-style fallacy ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Consensus venue ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Content forking/Internal ??? supplement ??? creator, one of the principal authors Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/2021#Flyer22 Frozen ??? obituary ??? one of the principal authors Wikipedia:Don't be high-maintenance ??? essay ??? wrote the overhauled version that changed it from the WP:Don't feed the divas attack page to an advice essay (both for the editorship-at-large and for editors accused of such behavior) Wikipedia:Don't bludgeon the process § No one is obligated to satisfy you ??? essay section ??? principal author Wikipedia:Don't "teach the controversy" ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Emerson and Wilde on consistency ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Fallacy of selective sources ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Fallacy of the revelation of policy ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Frequently misinterpreted sourcing policy ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:How to mine a source ??? how-to ??? principal author Wikipedia:Identifying and using style guides ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Identifying and using tertiary sources ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:In versus of ??? supplement ??? principal author Wikipedia:Logical_quotation_on_Wikipedia ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Manual of Style extended FAQ ??? frequently-asked-questions page ??? principal author (though I made the lead section a "guest editorial" from DGG); covers more than the summary MOS:FAQ Wikipedia:Notability/Historical ??? archival index, providing a comprehensive overview of the history of the development of the "notability" concept on Wikipedia ??? creator/maintainer Wikipedia:Proper names and proper nouns ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Race and ethnicity ??? essay, largely educational in nature ??? principal author Wikipedia:Reducing consensus to an algorithm ??? essay, verging on humor ??? principal author Wikipedia:Rouge editor ??? humor essay ??? one of the principal authors (the version before mine was here, as the text in a category page) Wikipedia:Specialized-style fallacy ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Tertiary-source fallacy ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Use modern language ??? essay ??? principal author Help:User CSS for a monospaced coding font ??? how-to ??? principal author (and actually transcluded from Template:Mxt/User CSS for a monospaced coding font, as it was created initially as a supplement to template documentation) Wikipedia:Use modern language ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:Using nicknames ??? guidance essay ??? principal author. Obsolete; almost all of it has been integrated into MOS:NICKNAME as of November 2017. Wikipedia:Wall of text ??? essay ??? substantial revision [9] to be balanced and less like a polemic Wikipedia:When unbundling admin power works ??? essay ??? principal author Wikipedia:WikiProject Animals/Article structure - wikiproject advice essay (draft) ??? principal author Wikipedia:Writing about breeds ??? essay ??? principal author; primarily for new-ish editors, but also an overview for those just new to the topic Wikipedia:You can search, too ??? essay ??? principal author User-space essays[edit] User:SMcCandlish/Adminship reform ??? draft proposal (more like a "what if", since it'll never happen unless WMF imposes it) User:SMcCandlish/Avoid quoting definitions ??? author; still in a draft state User:SMcCandlish/Discretionary sanctions 2013???2018 review ??? running log of issues related to WP:AC/DS and ArbCom's failure to address them. User:SMcCandlish/Gendered category criterion ??? draft proposal User:SMcCandlish/It ??? a "ha ha, only serious" piece. [It proved controversial when someone mistook it for "transphobic" because it had anything at all to do with pronouns. It's actually about self-aggrandizement for commercial, religious, classist, or plain ol' egotism reasons, and why Wikipedia will not write in such a manner to please such a subject.] User:SMcCandlish/TG-NB ??? a FAQ on what my actual views on TG/NB/GQ issues are, and on the history and results of the disputes about the above essay User:SMcCandlish/Notability and Deletion policy ??? my personal "ground-truth sitrep" on notability as a concept on WP; updated every few years (since 2006) User:SMcCandlish/RfA standards ??? what I (loosely) expect and do not expect out of candidates for WP:Requests for adminship User:SMcCandlish/RfC-replacement voting system ??? draft proposal (more like a "what if", since it'll never happen unless WMF imposes it) User:SMcCandlish/Why MoS talk pages have so much churn ??? a list of reasons and related matters User:SMcCandlish/Wikipedia's self-management and future ??? some thoughts on organizational life-cycle, editor retention, and dispute resolution Major successful proposals[edit] Key: Y = Proposal (or its gist) accepted N = Proposal rejected Y = Partly accepted, or other solution reached N = No consensus, or unclear resolution Very incomplete; I just started this list in January 2018 and have hardly added anything to it, since it's a lot of diff-digging for little utility. This is just what I happen to run across and think "oh, yeah, I remember that". Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 150#RfC on capitalization of the names of standardized breeds ??? Y Settled on following the capitalization used in breed standards; MOS:LIFE updated to reflect this. I was neutral on the matter, just insistent that we pick either that or lower-case, not continue to have no clear answer. (December 2018 ??? January 2019) Wikipedia:Proposed article splits ??? Y I created this noticeboard in July 2018, though originally as a section [10] of what is now Wikipedia:Proposed article mergers (suggesting a broader name); it ran that two-in-one way until April 2019, when it was split off into its own noticeboard by GenQuest. A series of merge proposals from 2016???2018 to consolidate biographical advice into Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography: Y All the consensus discussions went well, and I merged in material from MOS:LEAD, MOS:ABBREV, and MOS:CAPS in a long series of back-to-back edits [11] (June 2018). Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters/Archive 26#RfC: Capitalisation of traditional game/sports terminology ??? Y About over-capitalization of traditional sports and games; concluded in favor of lowercase; new section added to MOS:CAPS, and essentially identical material already in there about over-capitalizing dances and dance genres was merged into it. (January???February 2018) Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Biographies/2017 archive#Substantive revision of "Pseudonyms, stage names, nicknames, hypocorisms, and common names" ??? Y a bold total overhaul of the MOS:NICKNAMES section of MOS:BIO (before vs. after), based on my WP:Using nicknames essay; accepted almost verbatim (November 2017); there was some later clarification discussion, long but not major (December 2017). Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 126#RfC: In-universe name details of fictional characters, in article leads ??? Y Consensus: do not write articles on fictional characters as if real biographies (March???April 2016). Point later integrated into MOS:FICT. Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 126#RfC: Religion in biographical infoboxes ??? Y Removed contentious |religion= and |denomination= parameters from most biographical infoboxes (March???April 2016). See also Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 127#RfC: Ethnicity in infoboxes, which was going nowhere until I moved it to Village Pump right after the above RfC, then it closed with strong consensus against |ethnicity= parameter for similar reasons (March???April 2016). Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 156#Bird common name decapitalisation ??? Y Settled eight-year dispute about capitalizing vernacular names of organisms (don't, except where a proper name occurs, e.g. in Grevy's zebra). (April???May 2014) Ongoing proposals[edit] This list is primarily for my own convenience, though anyone who hates me can use it to be a pain and get themselves blocked for WP:HARASSment. Heh. Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Video games#General-topic article badly needed: Virtual-reality game ??? Proposed creation of stand-alone Virtual-reality game article, since the topic is distinct from virtual reality hardware, and we already have a Category:Virtual reality games. Talk:Virtual reality headset#Requested move 24 March 2021 ??? Move to Virtual-reality headset per MOS:HYPHEN and WP:CONSISTENT. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2021 March 20#South Scandinavian languages ??? South Scandinavian languages nominated for deletion, unless a proper target article/section can be found. Presently redirecting to Danish dialects, but does not appear to be a term for this (or for anything else ??? zero hits in Google Scholar (March 2021). Talk:Largest living flying birds according to wingspan#Requested move 20 March 2021 ??? Move to Largest living flying birds by wingspan per WP:CONCISE and WP:PRECISE/WP:RECOGNIZABLE (this is dialectal/colloquial use of "according to", and unnecessarily wordy anyway. Talk:The Bee's Knees#Requested move 20 March 2021 ??? Move to Bee's knees per WP:CONCISE, WP:THE, WP:NCCAPS, MOS:CAPS. Talk:Yan Tan Tethera#Section merge from Cumbric ??? It is duplicative of the material at the latter and inappropriate in huge chart form in the former; all that's needed there is a general summary (March 2021). Talk:Steve Gibson (computer programmer)#Requested move 9 March 2021 ??? Move to Steve Gibson (programmer) per WP:CONCISE, WP:DAB: don't use a longer disambiguation term than is necessary. Help talk:Citation Style 1/Archive 75#Requested move 8 March 2021 ??? move Template:Cite conference to Template:Cite presentation, since we cite presentations at conferences (or in conf. proceedings), not entire conferences. Talk:FKM#Merge from Viton ??? To merge spammy and redundant brand-name article into article on the substance (March 2021) Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Overhauling MOS:CAPS#Peoples and their languages ??? Proposal to fix problem that MOS:PN merge left a section on this in MOS:CAPS without any actual material pertaining to capitalization, and we actually have plenty to say about that (February 2021). Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Wording proposal on ethnic/racial terms, in light of the recent RfC ??? To address "[b|B]lack", "[c|C]olo[u]red", etc., since there's been a lot of churn about that, including an RfC with clear results which are not yet reflected in the guideline (February 2021). Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/France and French-related articles#Proposed simplification of MOS:FRENCHCAPS, which is more than a decade outdated ??? In short, this MoS subpage is contradicting others; we have a conflict between MOS:FRENCHCAPS, MOS:FOREIGNTITLES (and to a lesser extent MOS:FOREIGN, MOS:TM, etc.), and there's also a WP:OPERATITLE essay in the mix (December 2020). Talk:James D. Zirin#Merge book stubs here ??? Proposal to merge three questionably notable stubs into a single article that is more encyclopedic (December 2020). Help talk:Citation Style 1/Archive 72#Proposed documentation and parameter alias changes for Template:Cite episode ??? N to make the template more relevant in the age of digital media, and less US-centric (October 2020). Archived without resolution, so will need to be re-started. [Leaving it in this section, because I should do this, and while it is still quasi-recent.] Accepted proposals needing further work[edit] (That's further work by me or by anyone.) Talk:Southwestern Brittonic languages#Requested move 13 March 2021 ??? Move to Southwestern Brittonic per WP:CONCISE, WP:CONSISTENT. We don't need to append "language[s]" to language article when the name isn't ambiguous with that of a culture/ethnicity. N I rescinded this since it's become clear this needs to instead be mass RM of all the articles in the category hat have this "not actually ambiguous with anything" issue, rather (per WP:CONSISTENT) just moving this one article. Leaving it in this section (despite not an accepted proposal), since I actually need to do the work of building that RM. Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2020 December 19#Template:Hover title and Template:Tooltip ??? Y to merge the former to the latter. In progress: Re-develop code for better accessibility. Related: Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Accessibility#New tooltip testcases and Template:Tooltip/testcases Talk:L'Ange de Nisida#Requested move 8 December 2020 ??? Y moved from L'ange spelling per WP:COMMONNAME, MOS:FOREIGNTITLE, MOS:FOREIGN, MOS:FRENCHCAPS, and WP:CONLEVEL (involves a wikiproject WP:PROJPAGE essay) Followup: It's likely that essay needs revision as a result of this and other moves. Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals/2020/October#Folklore stubs ??? Y because we don't have a stub category tree for folklore, leading to lots of uncategorized and mis-categorized stubs. "The result of the debate was create." Confer with Pegship on building this out over time: "I suggest this be set up under Culture stubs | Other culture." Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals/2018/November#Breeds ??? Y For {{breed-stub}}, {{dog-breed-stub}}, and their categories (also a rename of an over-long one). Result: create parent-only category, and file breed stub sub-categories under it. (I'm not sure about the rename; may need to separately revist that.) Wikipedia talk:Categorization of people/Archive 10#A point needs clarification into guidance instead of non-guiding observation (and tacit approval) of conflict ??? Y Needs to proceed if MoS is going to incorporate that page by reference. Did not attract opposition, but I'm not sure there's enough feedback to declare consensus. May need to re-ask, or just go do it and see if it sticks. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Lists#Propose merging WP:Manual of Style/Embedded lists into WP:Manual of Style/Lists ??? Y Pretty straightforward. Some of this got done while I was on wikibreak, but some may still need to be completed. Wikipedia talk:Templates for discussion/Archive 26#RfC: Proposal to make TfD more RM-like, as a clearinghouse of template discussions ??? Y Just what it says. While this passed almost unanimously, nothing has been done to actually implement it yet. We need a listing template, and a bot that goes looking for it. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Temperament Test Society ??? Y Result: Merge to Temperament test. Non-notable org; not unencyclopedic, but should merge to Temperament test Wikipedia talk:Categories for discussion#The constant problem of category half-diffusion ??? Y clarification suggested (not drafted in detail) for WP:EPON. No opposition; suggestion to just WP:BOLDly do it. Will take some merging work. Talk:Toy dog#Merge from Toy Group ??? Y close out a WP:CONTENTFORK. Unopposed, but merges need to happen. Talk:Terrier#Merge from Terrier Group ??? Y close out a CONTENTFORK. Unopposed, but merges need to happen. Talk:Herding dog#Merge from Herding Group ??? Y close out a CONTENTFORK. Unopposed, but merges need to happen. Talk:List of dog breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club#Merge redundant articles ??? Y close out more CONTENTFORKs. Unopposed, but merges need to happen. Talk:Fédération Cynologique Internationale#Merge from "FCI [Whatever] Group" pages ??? Y close out more CONTENTFORKs. Unopposed, but merges need to happen. Talk:Breed standard#Merge from Breed standard (dog) ??? Y close out another CONTENTFORK. Unopposed, but merges need to happen. Talk:Non-Sporting Group#Requested move 20 February 2018 ??? Y de-capitalization multi-RM, plus some further merge ideas. Most articles moved; merges need to happen. Y One article was carved out of the RM by the closer, but without any actual basis and in direct contradiction of a recent RfC on the matter. Closer has been asked to reverse that; otherwise, I will re-RM this later. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters#RfC: Capitalisation of traditional game/sports terminology ??? Y WP will use "chess" and "baseball bat" not "Chess" and "Baseball Bat" (question didn't seem like it needed to be asked, until editwarring proved that it did). Some game and equipment articles still need to be lower-cased, as does lots of text in them. Template talk:Yesno#Support on/off and RfC below it ??? Y Change to protected template to detect on/off as well as yes/no, 1/0, true/false, etc. This should not have required this RfC, per WP:Common sense and WP:WIKILAWYER, but so it goes. Still needs the fix at Template:Post-nominals that inspired this to be reopened from original 2015 request in the first place. Follow-up request also open at Module talk:Yesno#Support on/off. Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2018 January 24#Template:IUPAC spelling US ??? Y merge some redundant ENGVAR templates, to just be parameters; merge needs to actually be done. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elf cat ??? Y Consensus was to merge WP:SUMMARY version to List of cat breeds, but it requires condensing the material. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Merge in MOS:PN ??? Y merge from WP:Manual of Style/Proper names almost unanimously supported, but need to actually do it. Wikipedia talk:Media help#Requested move 10 January 2018 ??? Y some cleanup work needs to be done, and possibly a merge (see final comment at discussion) Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 February 21#Category:Fédération Cynologique Internationale members ??? Y move to name without "members" (we don't have narrow subcats. without a parent cat.) Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 February 22#Category:Male dogs ??? Y upmerge as unencyclopedic; more sensible to split by dog type/role. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 February 22#Category:Glossaries of medical terms ??? Y upmerge to more concise duplicate/parent Category:Glossaries of medicine. Log of closed proposals Very incomplete; I just started this list in January 2018. Changes to WP:POLICY and WP:PROCESS pages[edit] Expect to see a lot of yellow and red icons in here, since writing and changing policy is hard. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#MOS:EPONYM ??? Y to centralize MoS points about eponyms (as of that writing, scattered in MOS:CAPS and other places); there was an initial bit of confused and very circular noise about this, from a single party, then no further dispute. (will probably end up in Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 221 or 222). Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Biography/2020 archive#Proposal to better address "The"/"the" in names of performers (etc.) and groups thereof ??? Y to fix the wikilawyering loophole of the rule in question presently only being in MOS:MUSIC (November 2020). Unanimous support; implemented as MOS:NAMEFMT. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Infoboxes/Archive 16#RfC on birthplace, nationality, and citizenship parameters with matching values ??? Y Is |birthplace=Paris, France |nationality=France} |citizenship=France redundant or helpful? I say redundant. Result: "Consensus has been determined that |nationality= or |citizenship= should not be used when the country would match that found in |birthplace=". Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 219#RfC: Use of Large Quotes in article space, and the Cquote template ??? Y I didn't open the RfC, but helped draft it (at [[Template talk:Cquote#Proposed changes re {cquote}]]) and have been "on" this issue since 2007 (I kid you not). Result: "Replace {{cquote}} with the code ... [having] the effect of converting {{cquote}} into {{quote}} in all mainspace uses, all at once. Make similar changes in {{rquote}}." Finally! This puts an end (at least in theory) to people injecting "decorative" quotations in articles that give WP:UNDUE attention to particular viewpoints. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters/Archive 28#Expand MOS:INSTITUTIONS to cover 'act', 'bill', 'resolution' and other items of legislation? ??? Y Someone else opened this, though I was quite active in it, and had suggested essentially the same RfC more than once; someone just beat me to it. Near-unanimous support. Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not/Archive 56#Change to "Memorial" ??? N Quasi-proposal (not "advertised") to tweak some policy wording for clarity. The respondents mostly appeared to misinterpret it, so it self-evidently wasn't formulated well enough to be a solid proposal. The underlying issue still remains to be addressed. Wikipedia talk:User pages/Archive 17#Minor GAMING/WIKILAWYER fix ??? Y Proposal to tweak some guideline wording for clarity. While my exact original edit wasn't accepted, it inspired a big round of group editing, and the section is now clearer, so mission accomplished. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Lists#Overly long list items ??? N We have no advice on this in ANY page, somehow. Proposal got some support, then a pile of opposes. I think this can still be worked out, but it will have to be phrased differently. Wikipedia talk:Article titles#Clarifying that UCRN is not a style policy ??? Y As expected, this did not actually produce a policy change (it will take more than one discussion about the fallacious idea that UCRN (WP:COMMONNAME) is about style). The discussion we did get through was productive, and had a strong influence on some later ones, such as Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 148#RFC on capitalization of prepositions. The underlying policy-wording problem (simply a lack of an MoS cross-reference) has been needing a fix for years, so we're not done yet. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Clarifying date ranges in YYYY???YY format ??? N A long-unresolved problem will remain so for now. Clear proposal was firehosed with knee-jerk, off-topic negativity by people who did not even read it, after a related and polarized WP:VPPOL thread pointed to the proposal. Will try again some other month. Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 152#Bot to deliver Template:Ds/alert ??? Y Opened because ArbCom just won't fix discretionary sanctions, left to their own devices. One of the intended effects of this (I did not actually expect the bot proposal to pass, just to spur action) did happen: the menacing {{Ds/alert}} template was totally overhauled. However, nothing about how DS operates was changed, so that will need to be reformed some other way. PS: Surprisingly, the bot proposal actually had majority support. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Words to watch#RfC Terms that can introduce bias [may end up in Archive 8 or 9] ??? Y Someone's re-re-RfC of my item immediately below. It passed this time, resulting in Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Easily confused terms, some decade-old advice that was removed from the main MoS page as too specific for it. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Words to watch/Archive 8#Re-RfCing Arab/Arabic ??? Y Closed without resolution, as needing to be re-proposed (which was done, and Y passed; see above entry). This was yet another followup to Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Arab, Arabic, Arabian (followup to Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 200#RfC Should the usage of the terms "Arab" and "Arabic" be guided by the Manual of Style? and Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 199#Arab and Arabic) ??? To restore long-standing material that probably shouldn't have been in the main MoS page, but is clearly appropriate for MOS:WTW. The last proposal was unopposed; since it was long-standing main-MoS-page material before being deemed too narrow there, I integrated it into MOS:WTW. This was WP:POINTily reverted, so did another RfC (and another). Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 205#Proposed footnote to discourage mass changes ??? Y No formal close, seems not to have come to a consensus. After three mass "enforcement of MoS" disputes in one week (with two ANI cases and a Village Pump thread about it, this seemed necessary at the time. We might have to revisit this if similar issues arise again. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 204#A consolidated MOS:SPORT? ??? Y No constructive input was received. Maybe re-approach this with a drafted merge next time. Informal proposal to take our sports-related advice, and pull some from wikiproject style essays, into a coherent single page. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 204#Merge some fiction stuff, too? ??? Y Same as above, but with regard to splintered fiction-related advice that has been policy-forking for no reason other than TV vs. film vs. anime specialized-style fallacies. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Biography/2018 archive#Proposed MOS:JOBTITLES tweak ??? Y Supported, unopposed, so implemented. Proposal to stop requiring capitalization of commercial and informal job titles in front of a personal name Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Biography/2018 archive#MOS:POSTNOM limit proposal ??? Y Original numeric limit idea rejected. Some follow-on discussion about other limitations was productive but stalled at copyediting phase. Worth revisiting later, to somehow limit the number of post-nominal acronyms after a biography subject's name in the lead. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 204#Expanded use of code syntax highlighting ??? Y No support for doing this, and the party in favor of the idea has stopped. Not an RfC, but a discussion of use of code syntax highlighting on sourcecode words in mid-sentence in regular prose. Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (people)#Conflict between WP:NCP and WP:MOS ??? Y proposal to fix the conflict (not an RfC, but "advertised" at relevant other talk pages); some discussion mostly about "guideline versus guideline" meta-policy, but the substantive proposal wasn't opposed, so I implemented it and it stuck; NPC has stopped conflicting with MOS:JR. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters/Archive 26#Scouting conflict with MOS:DOCTCAPS, MOS:JOBTITLE ??? Y Seeking to resolve a style conflict, in favor of lower-case (i.e., in favor of what the site-wide guideline says vs. a topical essay). Result: Didn't conclude anything in particular, and didn't have a formal closure. Some followup discussion at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters/Archive 27#Marines vs. marines (and Soldier, Sailor, Airmen, etc.), and innumerable prior discussions about overcapitalization of job and organization titles/roles, plus various later ones (e.g. about "Lord Mayor of [Where Ever]" article about roles/titles as such, versus "List of lord mayors of [Where Ever]" articles where it's a genericized plural/collective reference to a bunch of individuals) all indicate the direction this should eventually go. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 201#Re-deprecate and merge the ENGVAR-related templates that do not serve an encyclopedic purpose ??? N RfC, self-explanatory. Result: Consensus was against the specific proposal, though a prior RfC was in favor of doing something about this mess. So, this will need to be revisited later with a different proposal. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers/Archive 157#RfC on use of "crore" ??? Y RfC, to advise against use of "crore" for "ten million". Concluded to continue to permit it, but with some new limitations. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#RfC: "Allows to" ??? Y Accept or advise against this construction (mostly used by non-native English speakers but increasingly common in tech writing)? Conclusion: consensus it's bad grammar, but no consensus to add a line about it to MoS (it's not a frequent enough problem, supposedly. Trust me, it will be.) Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Wikipedia Awards#Barnstar bureaucracy (informal discussion) ??? Y While the response was defensiveness, a suggestion of an RfC or more formal proposal was made, and is the next step. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Proposal: Adopt WP:WikiProject Video games/Article guidelines into MoS ??? Y Was adopted into MoS, with some minor revision. (I was not a principal author of the material in the page.) Revisiting gendered categories: Let's have a clear criterion of "has or can have a proper article" (a discussion draft) ??? Y Proposal not supported, but something worth implementing instead did emerge: "The solution to the problem you raise is to have an explicit guideline that these categories are non-diffusing and for editors to enforce that." Mergers and splits[edit] Talk:North Britain#Merge in from North Briton ??? Y Proposal to merge North Briton, a redundant WP:CONTENTFORK stub, into North Briton, since north[ern] Britons are not a distinct ethnic, linguistic, or cultural group, thus not an encyclopedic topic on their own (January 2021). Talk:John Hornor Jacobs#Merge from The Incorruptibles ??? Y Merge stub (already AfDed once) on non-notable book into stub on marginally notable author, in lieu of speedy deletion for re-creation of previously deleted material (December 2020). Merge completed 3 January 2020 [12]. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jean Mill ??? N A case of trying to "rub off" notability from an encyclopedic topic to create a memorial bio? Wow, relisted three times (once more than policy sanctions), and went to ANI, and ran for almost a month, then very narrowly concluded to keep. I'm actually almost glad it did; the article improved a lot in the process, and is arguably encyclopedic now, though the sourcing is still weak (lack of depth or lack of independence). I would still prefer a summarization and merge to a section at Bengal cat. My main concern about it is that developers of animal breeds are very rarely notable, but most of them [living] are highly promotional, and this may open the door to a flood WP:COI / WP:SOAPBOX pseudo-articles. Just for the record, I have nothing against Mill or her Bengal breed ??? it's my favorite! (March 2019) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Temperament Test Society ??? Y Non-notable organization; merged to Temperament test. (November 2018) Talk:Teaching English as a second language#Requested merge: February 2016 ??? Y Merge from Teaching English as a second language and Teaching English as a foreign language into Teaching English as a second or foreign language Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rugby union/Archive 20#Merge redundant RU notability pages ??? N Proposal to merge and redirect Wikipedia:WikiProject Rugby union/Notability criteria to Wikipedia:WikiProject Rugby union/Notability; it makes no sense to have two competing WP:PROJPAGEs about the same thing. Discussion did not have a clear resolution, and both pages still have merge tags on them. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2020 February 5#Category:Fictional location redirects ??? Y Proposal to upmerge to Category:Redirects from fictional locations. Result: "rename Category:Redirects from fictional locations to Category:All fictional location redirects and restructure accordingly" (i.e., it was renamed and re-scoped to include redirects to fictional locations). Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2020 February 5#Template:R to anchor 2 ??? Y merge back into Template:R to anchor, and fix the latter to stop auto-categorizing things as unprintworthy (bots aren't allowed to do that either). Both propositions were accepted. Talk:Sports league#Needs to split or at least re-organize along pro/am lines ??? N Proposal to either re-scope into very clear sections, or split into Sports league and Amateur league. Draws on WP:SUMMARY, WP:NOTDICDEF, WP:SETINDEX as rationales. Did not garner commentary. Need to RfC it to get sufficient input to assess consensus. Wikipedia talk:Wikimedia sister projects/Archive 2#Requested move 12 March 2019 ??? N A proposal to merge WP:SISTER to be either a subpage of MOS:LINKING or more directly a part of MOS:LINKING#Interwiki links. While not supported, there does seem to be some support Y for merging part of that material to MOS:LINKING. My was point is that it's unproductive to have interwiki-linking-style-and-layout material in two different places; this may still be fixable in a narrower proposal. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 December 7#Category:Template-related templates ??? Y Upmerged to Category:Template namespace templates, as redundant. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 December 1#Category:Calf (cattle) ??? Y Upmerged to parent, Category:Cattle. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 December 1#Category:Individual calves ??? Y Upmerged to parent Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 June 30#Bplus-Class articles ??? Y Merged away a bogus article assessment class only used by one project, in the 2000s. Cleaning up all the pages and templates took more work than I thought. I did most of it, but a few good peeps found some spots I missed. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Supremely Partisan and Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Mother Court ??? N Proposals to combine some problematic articles that together might be viable (June 2018). The close of at least the second is questionable, claiming no one argued against the notablity of the book when that is clearly not true. This is a troubling result, as it suggests that an article on every nonfiction book from any major publisher can be kept as long as trivial micro-summary "reviews" appear in library trade publications. If this interpretation is allowed to stand, it will be nearly impossible to remove any article on any book that isn't fiction or self-published. Worse for the short-ish term, we are being WP:GAMED to provide author three promotional articles, one for him as a bio, plus two for his books. (June 2018) Update: The author article, James D. Zirin, was also nominated for deletion (by someone else), and also narrowly survived. As zero of the three articles has improved in the interim, I'm going to recommend they be merged. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 January 20#Category:Placer mining ??? Y Proposed deleting, but was technically upmerged to Category:Mining as it contained something not in the parent cat. yet. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 January 10#Category:Wikipedia Cabal decrees ??? Y Upmerged to Category:Wikipedia cabal humor. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 December 18#Category:Wikipedia proposals in brainstorming stage ??? Y Merged into Category:Wikipedia draft proposals. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 November 24#Category:Articles containing Pushto-language text ??? Y Merged into Category:Articles containing Pashto-language text. Talk:New Zealand rabbit#Proposed merges (March 2016) Y After a bunch of venting by one of "the usual suspects" (who for some time was trying to impede almost every single thing I did at breed articles), the merges did in fact proceed exactly as I suggested and for the reasons I suggested them. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Le vaillant petit tailleur ??? Y Non-notable book; redirected to author, ??ric Chevillard. (September 2015) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ComicsAlliance ??? Y Non-notable website (September 2012). It was re-created later, but after ComicsAlliance won a major industry award in 2015, which is enough to establish notability. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2008 January 22#Ruby Terrill Lomax and John Lomax III ??? N proposal to merge non-notable bios Ruby Terrill Lomax and John Lomax III to notable family member Alan Lomax. Closed as non-consensus, as a "trainwreck", and would have been better listed at WP:Proposed mergers, though it was at that time not well established. A dozen years later, these articles have not improved at all, and lack substantial coverage in secondary sources. (January 2008) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Card shark ??? Y To delete a WP:POVFORK re-created after merger of the original Card shark into Card sharp. The discussion initially closed as "keep", but they were later that month re-merged anyway Y, as I predicted, and by someone else. (December 2007) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Journalistic writing ??? Y Merge content-forked stub to News style (October 2007). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Punjab State Carrom Association ??? Y Proposal (accepted) to merge a bunch of local stuff into the nominated article. This was before WP:PM existed (June 2007). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Ralakan Corollary ??? Y WP:NFT nonsense; some random schmoe's comments about Godwin's law (July 2006). Deletions[edit] Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Flashflight (2nd nomination) ??? Y Non-notable product. First AfD was "no consensus", and over a decade later, the page has not improved even slightly (December 2020). Voodoo Tiki nominated for speedy deletion per G4, A7, and G11 (December 2020). Y It was speedily deleted; see User talk:Nobsonwiki#Why Voodoo Tiki was deleted - again for details. This was, I think, the 5th time it was deleted (not counting a move-related redirect deletion). Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2020 November 20#MOS:DISABILITY ??? Y cross-namespace redirect nominated for deletion (was pointing to an essay, not to part of MoS). Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2020 February 5#Category:Redirects from route numbers ??? Y Proposed to delete, as essentially unused and trivial; the end result was coming up for a use for it and populating it. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2020 January 25#Ashera ??? Y Bogus cat-breed (hoax/fraud) article nominated for simple deletion, or deletion and replacement with redir to unrelated Asherah; the latter was the result. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Double-nosed Andean tiger hound ??? Y Result: merge (but no page to merge to yet existed at the time). Non-notable cryptid cruft (definitely not a dog breed). Update: Now redirects to Pachón Navarro#Double-nosed Andean tiger hound; that article is about the real breed that is the likely primary ancestor of the alleged bifid-nosed population. Material has been trimmed of WP:OR and supposition. (November 2018) Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:PigeonIP/RMs ??? Y An anti-consensus RM "hit list" Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User talk:MjolnirPants/Editnotice ??? Y On grounds of WP:TPG, WP:OWN, WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:POLEMIC, WP:CONSENSUS, WP:GAMING, etc., all at once. Freedom Ranger (chicken) ??? WP:PROD Y ??? Non-notable, promotional, no independent sources. Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2018 December 13#Template:Trademark ??? N To delete redundant template which is also against WP:NOT#ADVICE, WP:NOT#BUREAUCRACY, WP:NODISCLAIMER. Ended up being kept on the basis of an argument (that trademarks are not intellectual property) which is completely wrong, legally. But whatever; template has no legit purpose but isn't harmful; someone else will just nominate it for deletion again later. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gary Price (librarian) Y ??? Non-notable bio, promotional purpose, nothing but primary sources. (December 2018) Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2018 November 14#Template:IOC name exception ??? Y This lingering bit of WP:BATTLEGROUNDing needed to be nuked back in 2014. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rise Nation ??? Y Non-notable e-sports team. Someone else technically nominated this, but was immediately blocked as a sock. The nom was correct, though, and I supplied the detailed deletion rationale. (July 2018) Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 June 5#Western Dance ??? Y to delete highly ambiguous redir; consensus was to convert to disambiguation page at Western dance Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 June 22#MOS:PLBLEAD ??? Y to delete useless "typo shortcut" for MOS:BLPLEAD. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 June 22#Wikipedia:SURANME ??? Y to delete useless "typo shortcut" for WP:SURNAME. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 June 22#Wikipedia:OPERPARA ??? Y to delete useless "typo shortcut" for WP:OPENPARA. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 February 4#Wikipedia:STOPCHANGINGIT ??? Y Got rid of pointless, confusing redir. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 February 2#State Investment Company ??? Y Deleted redirect, since term not mentioned at target article, and there are other entities that actually use this name, one of which may be notable. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Post-grunge lit ??? Y Zero sources cited use this term other than a self-published PhD thesis. This is a non-notable neologism. (January 2018) Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 January 16#Michael Buscemi ??? Y Potentially notable bio subjects should not redirect to their relatives, per WP:REDLINK. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 January 3#Category:WikiProject Masculinism ??? Y No such project any longer (superseded by WP:WikiProject Men's Issues). Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 January 1#Nick Lucero ??? Y Redlink will inspire article creation, and current redir is confusing. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 December 3#Category:Cattle hybrids ??? Y Misnomer for the contents (could be recreated with different content, if Category:Cattle breeds were subdivided into taurine, indicine/zebu[ine], and sanga). Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 October 23#Category:Wikipedians who consider themselves participants in many WikiProjects ??? Y Deleted as pointless. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jeannette H. Lee ??? N Kept as (barely) notable. I ended up significantly improving the article instead. (October 2017) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kineti-Go ??? Y Deleted per WP:NCORP, WP:PRODUCT, WP:PROMO. (March 2012) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chipo Chung ??? N Non-notable actor. Has had work, and some press coverage, but it isn't in-depth. This is yet another case of confusion of competence/employability with WP:Notability (a common problem in WP articles pertaining to the entertainment sector). The article was narrowly kept, and after nine+ years has not significantly improved. If anything, the person's claim to notability seems shakier now than it was then, with fewer roles of importance since the 2000s, no increase in non-trivial sourcing, and an increased focus on doing charity work, for which this person isn't notable either. (October 2011) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Orlando Eye ??? Y WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL / WP:TOOSOON deletion of a then-hypothetical project. Article was later re-created after it became non-iffy. (August 2011) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Female parliamentarians (2 nomination) ??? Y Non-encyclopedic, tautological WP:DICDEF (August 2011). Later redirected to proper article Women in government. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Carrie Borzillo ??? Y Non-notable bio (May 2010). Was re-created later N, and should probably be deleted again (has no independent and secondary in-depth coverage, only state-level and industry-insider coverage and awards, so is not encyclopedically notable}} Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joan Carroll Cruz ??? Y Non-notable writer (April 2010). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Incorruptibles ??? Y Non-notable book (April 2010). Article was rapidly re-created N in essentially the same form and without any better sourcing. I proposed it for merger into the author article, instead of speedy deletion, and Y this was done. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big hair ??? N WP:OR, non-encyclopedic, WP:DICDEF. This is a mishmash of different topics (many of which are notable), put together by an editor's subjective viewpoint that the hairstyles are "big" (March 2010). This was kept, but that was a mistake. The keep rationales basically boil down to WP:ILIKEIT / WP:IKNOWIT, and the closer ignored the actual policy-based arguments, especially WP:NOR. This should be AfDed again. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vanessa Lee Evigan ??? N Non-notable actor. The article was kept based on faulty reading of WP:ENT. Subject failed and still fails WP:GNG, and is simply competent/employable, plus related to someone notable. Over a decade later, it remains unsourced other than brief mention at unreliable website, plus subject's own primary-source material. I even correctly predicted that her non-notable musician brother would end up with an article because celeb-chasers on WP can't stand having the "set" of Evigans incomplete. There's another sibling article that also looks iffy, too. Greg Evigan is notable, but sharing genes with him and having some bit parts in TV shows does not WP:Notability make. (January 2010) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/DuPont Registry ??? N The WP:PROMO problem with this page (it had no sources but the company's own marketing materials) led me to reflexively nominate this without doing proper WP:BEFORE. (January 2010) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chalk to win ??? Y Deleted as WP:BOLLOCKS / WP:HOAX (January 2010). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Flashflight ??? N Questionably notable product; result: "no consensus" (December 2009). Over a decade later, the article had not improved even slightly, so I renominated it for deletion. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/500 (outdoor game) ??? Y Deleted WP:NFT game (December 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/3 Flies Up ??? Y Deleted non-notable/OR game variant (December 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Finball ??? Y Deleted WP:NFT game (November 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nguyen Thanh Nam ??? Y Non-notable businessperson (June 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pat Fleming (politician) ??? N Nominated per WP:POLITICIAN (non-notable candidate). I rescinded the nomination, as moot, after Fleming was elected, since the guideline was then satisfied (April 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mary Forsberg ??? Y Non-notable model/actor (February 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Steve Cook (songwriter) ??? Y Non-notable bio (February 2009). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Fresh Mex restaurants ??? Y Deleted as OR, basically. "Fresh Mex" is a registered trademark of a particular company, not a generic description, and we have no Fresh Mex article (October 2008). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PNG Cutthroat ??? Y Deleted WP:NFT game (March 2008). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amjad J. Qaisen ??? Y Deleted non-notable actor bio (February 2008) Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Exploding head ??? Y Deleted as a mixture of nonsense and fancruft, and fundamentally unencyclopedic in approach (December 2007). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Characters in Stargate ??? Y Deleted WP:CFORK; now redirects to Lists of Stargate characters (October 2007). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pool bocce ??? Y Deleted WP:NFT game (September 2007). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mexican pool ??? Y Deleted WP:NFT / WP:HOAX game (June 2007). Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Balfour's Law ??? Y Deleted WP:NFT Internet meme-cruft (someone's attempt to write an add-on for Godwin's law). Deleted per WP:NEO, since WP:N wasn't a guideline yet (July 2006). Moves/renames/re-targetings/re-scopings[edit] Talk:Icon#Requested move 10 April 2021 ??? N group move to better comply with WP:ATT (esp. WP:PRIMARYTOPIC) and with MOS:DAB: move Ikon ??? Ikon (disambiguation), then Icon ??? Ikon, then Icon (computing) ??? Icon. Someone's immediate followup proposal, Talk:Icon#Requested move 19 April 2021, for Icon ??? Icon (religious art), then Icon (disambiguation) ??? Icon, also failed to get consensus, so we're stuck for now with a mess that fails to comply with WP:AT and WP:DAB. Talk:Yan tan tethera#Requested move 13 March 2021 ??? Moved from the over-capitalised Yan Tan Tethera, per WP:NCCAPS, MOS:CAPS, MOS:INCIPIT, MOS:GAMECAPS. Talk:Nornisk Nickel#Requested move 5 March 2021 ??? Y Moved from Nornickel to the actual company name. The abbreviated version is pretty frequent, but is not the WP:COMMONNAME. Talk:Forced labour#Requested move 28 February 2021 ??? Y Moved from Unfree labour per WP:COMMONNAME. Talk:Goliards#Requested move 12 February 2021 ??? Y Rename from Goliard, as a naturally plural title. Talk:Proper and common nouns#Requested move 1 January 2021 ??? Y moved from Proper noun and common noun, per WP:CONCISE. Talk:Paramashiva (film)#Requested move 31 December 2020 ??? Y moved from Paramashiva so that can redirect Parashiva per WP:PRIMARYREDIRECT and WP:ASTONISH. Wikipedia talk:Arbitration/Index/Principles#Requested move 8 December 2020 ??? Y to move currently maintained page from Wikipedia talk:Arbitration/Index/Principles 2 to Wikipedia talk:Arbitration/Index/Principles, and move the dead page then occupying that pagename to "Wikipedia:Arbitration/Index/Principles (historical)" or something (it ended up going to Wikipedia:Arbitration/Index/Principles/Pre-2020). Template talk:Blockquote#Requested move 1 December 2020 ??? Y from Template:Quote, to match <blockquote>, and to discourage {{Quote|Too-short block quotations like this.}} Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Disability/Style guide#Requested move 20 November 2020 ??? Y to Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Disability/Style_advice, since this is not a guideline and the name is confusing (this is a {{WikiProject style advice}} essay) Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2020 November 20#WP:OPED ??? [verification needed] to retarget to same Signpost page as WP:OP-ED, especially since the original MoS-page target already has MOS:OP-ED, etc., and the whole point of "MOS:" shortcuts is to not "hog" all the mnemonic "WP:" ones for MoS stuff. Talk:Mob rule#Requested move 21 November 2020 ??? Y Swapped Mob rule ??? Mob rule (disambiguation), then Ochlocracy ??? Mob rule per WP:PRIMARYTOPIC and WP:JARGON. Talk:Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff#Requested move 26 October 2020 ??? N to move to vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff per MOS:JOBTITLES and previous discussion on that page. Due to some initial confusion, this turned into a trainwreck, and ended no consensus. Talk:Arkansas militias during Reconstruction#Requested move 21 October 2020 ??? Y from Arkansas Militia in Reconstruction, so it makes some kind of sense. Template talk:Xmark#Requested move 15 October 2020 ??? Y to swap original name Template:Cross with is redirect Template:Xmark, since "cross" is ambiguous. Talk:Non-linear editing#Requested move 15 October 2020 ??? Y from Non-linear editing system, per WP:CONCISE and to better agree with lead and scope. Talk:Rafeiro do Alentejo#Requested move 21 February 2020 - N Rename another Portuguese dog breed to the official FCI name for it in English, instead of the original Portuguese name. No consensus was reached on what name to use, so it remains at the status quo article title. Talk:DMOZ#Requested move 21 February 2020 ??? N My argument was that it was renamed Curlie, and is not defunct, so the page needs to be move and to be updated. Other editors want to treat them as separate entities. I'm not sure there's any sourcing to back that position, but it is what it is for now. Talk:Saint Miguel Cattle Dog#Requested move 20 February 2020 ??? Y Moved 3 Portuguese dog breeds to English-language names per WP:USEENGLISH. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2020 February 5#Category:Catchphrases ??? N Proposed merge to Category:Slogans. Opposed but on a WP:IKNOWIT "dictionarian" basis that isn't actually supported by dictionaries at all, and which we can see is already causing miscategorization. This will have to be revisited eventually; the problem is still there, and putting our heads in the sand won't fix it. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2020 February 5#Category:Redirects from catchphrases ??? Proposed merge to Category:Redirects from slogans. Ditto the above pseudo-resolution. Talk:Council of governments#Requested move 5 February 2020 ??? N Suggested rename to either council of government (the concept) or councils of governments (the entities); "council of governments" seemed logically wrong. However, I appear to have misinterpreted. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2020 January 30#Category:One-shot (comics) ??? N Proposed to move to "Category:One-shot comics and manga" because it includes a manga subcat. and there's no need for the punctuation. I somewhat suspected the outcome might be that manga are a subset of comics, thus that title would be redundant. But I rather hoped otherwise. Treating manga as nothing but a subset both denies a major West/East cultural difference, and requires more cat. changes (to ensure that comics cats. which can apply to manga either do so directly or via a manga subcat, and to ensure that all extant manga cats. have at least one comics parent cat.) And we still don't need the parentheses. Talk:The Hexer (TV series)#Requested move 14 January 2020 ??? Proposal to move TV series to The Hexer, and move the "film" (compressed series synopsis) from The Hexer to The Hexer (film), per WP:PRIMARYTOPIC, or possibly even merge the "film" into the series article as a section. Y The "film" article was moved, but the The Hexer (film) was not moved, with The Hexer now becoming a two-item disambiguation page. This is a poor result per WP:TWODABS, since a reasonable PRIMARYTOPIC case can actually be made. There was only one respondent, who did not reply to rebuttal. So, this is probably best re-RMed later, with some notice at relevant wikiprojects (TV, film, video games, fantasy) to draw in sufficient editorial input to reach a real consensus. Template talk:Humorous essay#Requested move 28 November 2019 ??? N Proposal to move to Template:Humor essay mostly for WP:PRECISE reasons (i.e., whether an essay is actually humorous is a matter of individual readers' subjective opinions, not authorial intent); did not succeed. Closed as not moved, yet there were only two respondents, and they both relied on the "well it can mean ..." rationale that was rejected in the Talk:Glossary of music terminology move, below. So, this should probably be re-RMed at some point on a purely WP:CONCISE and WP:CONSISTENT basis, and hopefully with enough input that it's not a WP:FALSECONSENSUS based on fallacious reasoning again. Talk:Off-off-Broadway#Requested move 1 December 2019 ??? Y Moved to off-off-Broadway from Off-Off-Broadway, per MOS:GENRE and MOS:DOCTCAPS; sources are not consistent in capitalizing it, and it's not a proper name but a descriptive phrase. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2019 December 6#H???O ??? Y Retargeted from Properties of water to Water. Talk:Glossary of music terminology#Requested move 19 January 2020 ??? Y Moved to Glossary of musical terminology per WP:CONCISE, WP:PRECISE, WP:CONSISTENT. Template talk:Main talk other#Requested move 18 November 2019 ??? Current name is just confusing. Y Closed as no consensus due to inability to agree on a consistent set of names for that entire template family. Closer suggests re-RMing it after a while, with a clarified proposal. Talk:Das Kapital, Volume I#Requested move 6 December 2019 ??? Y Multi-RM of all the "Capital, Volume X" articles to move to "Das Kapital, Volume I", etc. to agree (WP:CONSISTENT) with main article title, Das Kapital. Followup to the RM immediately below this one. Talk:Das Kapital#Requested move 22 November 2019 ??? Y Idea to nove to Capital (book) (per WP:USEENGLISH, and to be WP:CONSISTENT with Capital, Volume I ??? Capital, Volume IV) was rejected (which is consonant with a prior RM). However, the alternative proposal to move the volume articles to a name consistent with the main one met with support, and that was laster opened as a new RM, which succeeded (see entry immediately above). Talk:In-group and out-group#Requested move 11 November 2019 ??? Y Moved from Ingroups and outgroups, per WP:CONSISTENT, WP:SINGULAR. Talk:Catahoula Leopard Dog#Requested move 8 November 2019 - Y Moved from Louisiana Catahoula Leopard dog, per WP:COMMONNAME, WP:CONCISE Talk:Three-man chess#Requested move 28 October 2019 ??? Y Multi-page RM to fix rampant over-capitalization (Three-Man Chess, etc.) of chess variants, per MOS:GAMECAPS. Talk:North Ossetia???Alania#Requested move 9 March 2019 ??? Y Multi-page RM, mostly MOS:DASH, plus some WP:CONSISTENT and WP:CONCISE issues; moved away from North Ossetia ??? Alania, etc. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2019 March 10#Category:Wikipedia character-substitution templates ??? Y We don't need to stick "Wikipedia" at the front of category names unless there's a likelihood of confusion with real-world topics (or we should do it to all of them just in case, to be consistent ??? but not be veering back and forth for no reason). Talk:Lumiere (database)#Requested move 26 February 2019 ??? Y Moved from LUMIERE, because it's not an acronym (I originally suggested Lumiere (website), but we settled on "(database)". Talk:Media Programme of the European Union#Requested move 26 February 2019 ??? Y Moved from MEDIA Programme, because it's not an acronym, and "Media Programme" by itself is ambiguous. Talk:George Hodel#Requested move 7 February 2019 ??? Y Moved from George Hill Hodel, as over-disambiguation (by middle name, which we don't do) for something that isn't ambiguous with any other article anyway Talk:Winter sports#Requested move 29 January 2019 ??? Y Moved from List of winter sports to Winter sports (and against the proposal Winter sport; I didn't open the RM, but provided the title that prevailed. Talk:Attack on Titan (TV series)#Requested move 18 January 2019 ??? Y Moved from List of Attack on Titan episodes, with that page now redirected to Attack on Titan (TV series)#Episode list; we don't need a "List of Foo episodes" page unless and until a embedded episode list becomes too long for a main show article, and no such list article should exist without such a main show article in the first place. Talk:Boar???pig hybrid#Requested move 6 December 2018 ??? Y Original article name, Iron Age pig, and the slant of the article, was an WP:UNDUE marketing focus (on non-notable brand or pseudo-breed) in what should be (and now is) a general article on boar???pig hybrids and their environmental and agricultural impact. Talk:Wiley (publisher)#Requested move 4 December 2018 ??? Y Moved from John Wiley & Sons per WP:COMMONNAME, WP:OFFICIALNAME, WP:CONCISE, WP:RECOGNIZABLE Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Speedy#Current requests (permalink) ??? Y Unopposed. Category:Chicken hybrids ??? Category:Chicken crossbreeds; these words are not synonymous, and all entries in the category are crossbreeds. A cat. redirect was left behind briefly, but later removed as unnecessary. Talk:Media Source Inc.#Requested move 19 November 2018 - Y Unopposed. Media Source as article title for this company article failed several WP:CRITERIA; now a disambiguation page. Talk:Ricochet (dog)#Requested move 16 November 2018 ??? Y old title Surf Dog Ricochet failed WP:CONCISE and WP:CONSISTENT among other P&G; this was a re-RM of one listed below which closed against the move despite policy and sources supporting it. Talk:Lists of domestic animal breeds#Requested move 15 November 2018 ??? Y No such thing as a breed of wild animal. Talk:VIBE Vixen#Requested move 12 November 2018 ??? Y Over-capitalization cleanup (also of what is presently URB (magazine)) Talk:Science Daily#Requested move 11 November 2018 ??? Y correct publication title is ScienceDaily Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ICZN ??? Y Deleted two-item disambiguation page and redirected to the WP:PRIMARYTOPIC; both items in the DAB page really resolved to the same encyclopedic topic anyway: a nomenclature code and its publisher. (August 2018) Talk:Nithyananda#Requested move 18 July 2018 ??? Y moved from Swami Nithyananda, per MOS:JOBTITLE, WP:NTITLE. Talk:Swami Vivekananda#Requested move 18 July 2018 ??? N (So much for WP:CONSISTENT.) Nominated per MOS:JOBTITLE & WP:NTITLE, just like the above case. [A large block of them are missing; I forgot to keep track.] Talk:Henry III of France#Why the anglicized "Henry"? ??? Y Huge WP:CONSISTENT mess to clean up; this is an open "what should we do?" discussion more than an RM per se, though I do make a proposal to favor Henri for French subjects and Henry for English ones. Result: No consensus reached, with regard to that article or the entire lot of them, so this will need to be revisited again later. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Speedy#Opposed nominations (at Category:Steeplechase horse racing to Category:Steeplechase), and eventually Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 February 28#Category:Steeplechase horse racing ??? Y Consensus went with an alternative disambiguation. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 February 20#Complex Media ??? Y Delete an inappropriate redir from company to product; alternative proposal to link to the (now identified) parent company. Conclusion: use alternative redirect target. Talk:NATO phonetic alphabet/Archive 2#Requested move 2 February 2018, and User talk:BD2412#"NATO" phonetic alphabet ??? N Request to change close of Talk:NATO phonetic alphabet#Requested move 2 February 2018 to a simple "no consensus" instead of the PoV-laden original close; otherwise take to WP:MR. This admin nuked his entire talk page and replaced it with an "I'm busy" note [13], which makes it difficult to demonstrate the level of hostility thrown at me when I made this request. Too late for MR now; will need to re-RM it. Talk:Gun control/Archive 21#???Requested move 18 February 2018 ??? Y Not my proposal, but an important RM I've supplied a lot of input into. Closed as "no consensus" but needs to be revisited, and I may do it myself. Talk:Water skiing ??? Y RM to Waterskiing to reflect more common usage. Closed as "no consensus", so will have to try it again later with more sourcing. Talk:Ricochet (dog)#Requested move 22 February 2018 ??? original RM: N move to Ricochet (dog) from Surf Dog Ricochet for WP:CONSISTENT with contents of Category:Individual dogs, away from a marketing appellation used in <10% of reliable sources. Was closed as "Not moved" (i.e. no consensus) despite there being no policy- or sourced-based reason to retain the present misnomer title (bad close that just "counted votes"). Y Re-RMed later with additional rationales (see above). Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 February 4#Wikipedia:Game guide ??? Y retargeted to same place WP:GAMEGUIDE, instead of to MOS:VG. Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 January 24#Nicastrese ??? Y retargeted from Nicastrese to Nicastro (instead of Nicastrese goat) Talk:Australian White sheep#Requested move 24 January 2018 ??? Y multi-page RM to Australian White sheep, etc., from naturally ambiguous names. Talk:Brown Caucasian cattle#Requested move 24 January 2018 ??? Y multi-page RM to Brown Caucasian cattle, etc., from naturally ambiguous names. Talk:Guilty Party (video game)#Requested move 23 January 2018 ??? Y moved from Guilty Party which now redirects to the Guilty party disambiguation page Talk:Party Party#Requested move 23 January 2018 ??? Y moved disambiguation page from The Party Party, per WP:THE and to match its own content Talk:Two-tone (music genre)#Requested move 23 January 2018 ??? Y move from 2 Tone (music genre) which is confusing the genre with 2 Tone Records trademark Wikipedia talk:List of sound files#Requested move 10 January 2018 ??? Y RM, to no longer be a subpage of a redirect (moved from Wikipedia:Sound/list) Help talk:Media#Requested move 10 January 2018 ??? Y multi-page RM to "Help:" namespace (moved from Wikipedia:Media help, etc.) Help talk:Pictures#Requested move 6 January 2018 ??? Y RM to "Help:" namespace; moved from Wikipedia:Picture tutorial, but to an even shorter name than I suggested (which was Help:Picture tutorial). Template talk:More citations needed#Requested move 30 December 2017 ??? Y RM to plain-English name (from jargony and actually ambiguous Template:Refimprove); someone's opened an MR about it here Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 December 18#Category:Wikipedia procedure header templates, etc. ??? Y Renamed to "procedural". Talk:Dobermann#Requested move 5 December 2017 ??? Y Moved to internationally preferred name, not the WP:SYSTEMICBIAS one favored by a single US-based group Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 November 15#Category:World sports champions ??? Y Renamed to Category:World champions by sport. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 November 13#Category:World snooker champions ??? Y A more complex solution was arrived at than my original proposal. Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 November 4#Category:Domesticated pigeon breeds by country of origin and subcats ??? Y Renamed to "Pigeon breeds by country of origin". [huge gap] Talk:English in New Mexico#Requested move 24 October 2015 ??? Y Moved from New Mexican English, which asserted a dialect (that not all sources agree is distinct) and is too narrow a subtopic [years missing] Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Voodoo Tiki ??? Y Re-userfication of an insufficiently sourced draft (previously deleted then later userfied on the condition that it not be moved out of userspace until fully sourced (February 2008). Was later re-created in mainspace in at least as a bad for as the original, so nominated for speedy deletion. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rounder ??? Y Deleted unsourced WP:DICDEF page with WP:DAB page that links to all the articles to which various meanings of the term apply, and at which they are sourced. (July 2007) Changes to template functionality[edit] Template talk:Infobox person/Archive 35#Proposal: Repurpose and redocument the home_town parameter ??? N to replace this trivia parameter with one for places of residence during period of notability. Insufficient feedback for consensus to be clear. RfC it? Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Infoboxes/Archive 16#RfC on birthplace, nationality, and citizenship parameters with matching values ??? See entry under #Changes to WP:POLICY and WP:PROCESS pages, above. Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 219#RfC: Use of Large Quotes in article space, and the Cquote template ??? See entry under #Changes to WP:POLICY and WP:PROCESS pages, above. Template talk:R from television episode#RfC: The template wording's accuracy ??? N To resolve a dispute about instructions in the template. No consensus was reached. Template talk:Interlanguage link#Use square brackets ??? Y Style cleanup; implemented with unanimous support. Template talk:Yesno#Support on/off and RfC below it ??? Y Changes to a protected template to now detect on/off (as well as its then-current yes/no, 1/0, true/false, etc.). This should not have required this RfC, per WP:Common sense and WP:WIKILAWYER, but so it goes. Module talk:Yesno#Support on/off detection ??? Y Module-improvement request accepted; a follow-up to the successful proposal at the template version, since it did not carry over, somehow, to the module implementation. Nominations of others for permissions, etc.[edit] Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Page mover#ProcrastinatingReader ??? Y Nomination of editor for WP:Page mover permission. Was accepted [14]. Sockpuppet investigations, requests for arbitration, sanctions/remedies[edit] </noinclude> Sockpuppet investigations, requests for arbitration, sanctions/remedies[edit] I won't list all of them here, just those that "did something". Lots of noticeboard action just archive away without closure, or close as "no action at this time". Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement#WanderingWanda ??? Y Won't go into details here. Closed as something to be addressed by ArbCom directly, but closed with admonition [15]. That was my actual expectation of and intent for the outcome, though the suggested topic-ban would also have been appropriate. Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Flyer22 and WanderingWanda ??? Y Was not a party, but provided evidence [16] and analysis [17] to thwart a WP:POVRAILROAD attempt. Case was going to close with simply a mutual interaction-ban [18], which is what was proposed/expected at the start, before it was hijacked for railroading. Case closed without formal decision [19] upon the death, after a long illness, of one of the parties (see WP:Deceased Wikipedians/2021#Flyer22) Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive1004#Proposed image-placement topic ban for Beyond My Ken ??? Y Long-term editwarring case. As I expected, it did not result in the proposed T-ban; it did result in a self-imposed restriction, which is more than what I did expect (just a warning). So, issue solved. Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive1003#Fæ's return to canvassing and incivility/aspersions in gender-related disputes ??? Y Closed without consensus; remanded to Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case#Conduct dispute involving gendered pronouns (still open as of March 2018) Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/107.215.53.37/Archive#06 January 2019 ??? Y A pair of IPs used by the same person for consistent vandalism. Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive997#Incivility, disruptive "dumping" in threads, and activism against notability guidelines by James500 ??? Y Warning issued (the actual intent, though it came close to a topic ban) Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Best known for IP ??? Y A set of disruptive and uncivil IP socks was positively IDed and blocked. Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive997#Disruptive editing by User:IQ125 ??? Y Topic ban from terriers, and dog-fighting. Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Civility in infobox discussions ??? Y Request to include someone as a party in the RfArb about someone else; was accepted, but the end result was just a warning. Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Tobias Conradi/Archive#10 December 2017 ??? Y A set of IP socks was positively IDed and blocked. Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive968#Editwarring, incivility, etc. by FleetCommand (November 2017) ??? Y Disruptive editor topic-banned from MoS. Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive189#Darkfrog24 (January???February 2016) ??? Y MoS's longest-term disruptor finally topic-banned. This was, I think, the fifth such noticeboard action, the second by me; same user has since got blocked, got indeffed, had talk-page access revoked, and had multiple appeals declined. Major templates[edit] {{Rp}} (The template that keeps us from doing awful things when citing the same source many times in the same article. Came to me in a flash after User:Fuhghettaboutit bemoaned how many lines were created by citing the same book for so many entries at Glossary of cue sports terms. Today, it's probably the most widely used of the "support" templates for our source citation system. Forthcoming improvements to MediaWiki's handling of the <ref> system may eventually make this template obsolete. We can hope so.) {{CompactTOC}} as we now know it (There were many radically different templates of this sort, and I merged all of them and their features and added many new ones.) {{glossary}}, {{term}}, {{defn}} (See also MOS:GLOSSARIES.) {{em}}, {{strong}}, {{var}}, {{kbd}}, {{samp}}, {{dfn}} and most of the rest of Category:Semantic markup templates {{' "}}, {{" '}}, {{" ' "}}, {{-'}}, {{'-}}, {{-"}} and {{"-}} (quotation-mark kerning templates) {{Cue sports nav}} {{WikiProject Cue sports}}, {{WikiProject New Mexico}}, and several others Less major ones: {{TfR}}, {{TfR2}}, {{TfR notice}} Loads more, I just fire and forget (literally ??? I'm often surprised to look in a template's history and see that I created it and don't remember). Categories[edit] Category:Cue sports (I created and have been one of the most active maintainers of most of its subcategories.) Category:Insular ecology (I didn't write the articles in it, I just noticed they were scattered about and not categorized sanely, so now they are.) Lots that I'm forgetting. Non-admin closures[edit] Just started tracking this in September 2017 (and then forgot until early 2020). I sometimes do non-admin closure of discussions (RfCs, RMs, etc.) and push right up to the boundary of what a non-admin can do, with that I believe are positive results. Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Toy portals (2020-01-30) Disruptive-turning RfC on whether the US dollar "really" is a fiat currency: permalink ??? someone barnstarred me for this one. (2017-09-30) Nationality of Jose Antonio Vargas: permalink to discussion and closure (2017-09-10) Misc.[edit] Some shortcuts that seem like they should have been there forever weren't, and were created by me. I usually forget, but a few important ones are WP:ARCA [20], WP:AEIS [21], and WP:SANCTIONGAME / WP:SANCTIONGAMING [22],[23]. Gallery of contributed images[edit] Some of the images I've contributed under GFDL/CC (and sometimes PD) are displayed as thumbnails in my Gallery Page. To-do list[edit] To-do list for User:SMcCandlish: edit?·?history?·?watch?·?refresh?·?Updated 2020-11-28 Unsorted additions: Write short "WP:There are oracles" contra WP:There are no oracles: 1) consensus is not what is decided in RfCs and written down, it is what the community does (which we sometimes bother to write down, in part); 2) ergo, long-term, policy-experienced editors can in fact predict outcomes with a high success rate.

WP:Manual of Style/Glossaries is about ready for formal proposal, but might work better if forked into a Help page and a MoS page. WP:WikiProject Animals/Article structure is stalled, though it's unlikely noticed since it hasn't been broadly "advertised" yet.

Copyediting, encyclopedizing and formalizing any juvenile, colloquial, non-neutral or poorly thought out language in articles Fixing miscellaneous "bad stuff" - vanity/marketing language, crystalballing, etc. Proposing (and sometimes performing) merges of redundant articles Adding obvious missing redirects and making sure they go to useful places Educating misinformed arguments (per logic or Wikipedia policy) on talk pages Trying to resolve circular disputes on talk pages Defending articles from AfD when the reasoning for the deletion is specious, especially "NN per nom" me-tooism. Nominating truly atrocious crap for AfD (or for SD, or just prod'ing them) Learning a lot concerning things I didn't know about, on all sorts of topics Having a good time!

Other editors may wish to examine carefully any edits I ever make to any of the following topics: Stanton McCandlish (me; while I would easily pass WP:GNG and WP:BIO, I have no article, have never had one, and don't want one - that would be a bit creepy to me, and friends with articles say they just cause trouble for them (personal attacks, misinformation, etc.), and I helped one get theirs deleted to protect their privacy. Protecting Yourself Online (I co-authored a book by this title, ISBN 9780062515124; it has no article and is surely not notable enough to have one) Wilcox???McCandlish law (something amusing that a colleague and I came up with in the '90s; someone else created an article about it here, before I even became a WP editor; it was subsequently deleted on notability grounds, and should probably stay that way, though it might make a good WP:Essay, as it applies to talk pages here) Things I could vaguely, conceivably have a conflict of interest on, due to past connections Too many clients to individually list here (and some are covered by NDAs anyway); I know better than to edit articles about them. CryptoRights Foundation (I was their volunteer CCO/Communications Director for several years, starting 2003; it bugged me somethin' fierce that it did not have an article until recently, but it seemed grossly inappropriate to even start a "just the facts" stub on it, and someone else finally did) Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF] (held various job titles there, including Program Dir., Communications Dir., etc., and was editor of their EFFector newsletter, and the webmaster of eff.org, 1993–2002) Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign (this was largely my brainchild, as a part of my professional life at EFF; it was an EFF project not a personal one) ??? Note: The present article is a bogus WP:COATRACK for MIT SAFE, which supported the campaign but had nothing at all to do with its genesis. Someone please fix this, per WP:SPLIT.

"WP:ANI is like a huge orgy.

I hate filk, with a passion, yet I somehow loved this. Possibly the worst ever of my own typos. (See edit summary used.) I think I was channeling Ancient Finnish or something. "Karl Marx, founder of modern Marxism ...." in Animal Farm, as of 13 January 2010 version (we all know that ancient Marxism was of course founded by Marxus Aurelius, right?) From the "unclear on the concept" department Rather remarkable definition of "watch your language". Hairy ball theorem Perhaps the funniest real article name on Wikipedia. (It's a real math/physics theorem, and not intrinsically funny, though a bit amusing.) Unbelievably selective evidence Someone concerned about overlinking in articles actually used the Professional wrestling article as alleged smoking-gun "proof" of rampant overlinking across Wikpedia, requiring (naturally) much more stringent anti-linking wording in WP:LINKING. Of course that article in particular would have overlinking, along with just about every other noob error, except when periodically cleaned up by experienced, neutral editors who don't believe in fairytales. The article is clearly indicative of nothing but the nature of that topic's fanbase (and thus its most frequent editorial pool). "Presumably we're talking about Life on Mars (TV series) here? John Carter 20:56, 13 April 2007 (UTC)" A comment posted at WP:COUNCIL/P, on a proposal for a "WikiProject Life on Mars"; if you don't get why this is hysterically funny, just move on ??? it's an old-school sci-fi geek thing. Very strange font activism vandalism of my sig at a talk page Did you know ... that there are not just regular vandals but ones with really, really weird agendas lurking in Wikipedia? http://www.well.com/~mech/WP/FunnyWikipediaCaptcha.jpg I'm not sure Wikipedia's account-creation CAPTCHA database should include every word... >;-) Smartest things I've seen on Wikipedia[edit] Just a few particularly well-thought-out bits by other editors. They aren't necessarily mindblowing or anything, just insightful and well-put. "We must always do what is best for the readers, without exception.

While this is well-deserved praise for the how-to essay series in support of WP:MOS by Tony1 (which starts here), this also gets at why style on Wikipedia is not trivia or trivial. "I ... had no problem whatsoever learning wikicode when I started writing and improving encyclopedia articles in 2009. I do not want to learn new software features that are less productive and less intuitive than old software features. I welcome any upgrades that are entirely intuitive and non-disruptive to existing editors. I will oppose ill-conceived and poorly-implemented make-work projects for professional programmers.

This is why policy pages aren't "enforced", but quoted; if people aren't convinced by what policy pages say, they should usually say something else. The major exception to this stability is when some small group, either in good faith or in an effort to become the Secret Masters of Wikipedia, mistakes its own opinions for What Everybody Thinks.

"If a high-profile [Wikipedian] poll is conducted that brings in widespread participation from editors who had previously stayed away from [the] venue, and the holdouts who had been stonewalling and preventing progress merely slouch, stuff their hands in their pockets, and walk away, then that proves that they knew full well that their arguments were not sufficiently persuasive, or didn???t have sufficient numbers, or both. ...

Smartest Wikipedia-relevant things I've seen from off-site[edit] Transgender activist Leslie Feinberg, 2006:[1] For me, pronouns are always placed within context. I am female-bodied, I am a butch lesbian, a transgender lesbian???referring to me as "she/her" is appropriate, particularly in a non-trans setting in which referring to me as "he" would appear to resolve the social contradiction between my birth sex and gender expression and render my transgender expression invisible. I like the gender neutral pronoun "ze/hir" because it makes it impossible to hold on to gender/sex/sexuality assumptions about a person you're about to meet or you've just met. And in an all trans setting, referring to me as "he/him" honors my gender expression in the same way that referring to my sister drag queens as "she/her" does. ^ Tyroler, Jamie (28 July 2006). "Transmissions ??? Interview with Leslie Feinberg". CampCK.com. Archived from the original on November 23, 2014. Retrieved 17 November 2014. Allegedly sensible or clever things I've come up with here[edit] Wikipedia policies are what are required for the project operate at all; guidelines are what help it operate smoothly; high-acceptance essays are what help its operators not make fools of themselves; and miscellaneous essays are part of the community mindshare that helps shape all of the above over time. (At WT:Don't bludgeon the process, in a "guidelines vs. essays" thread; 23:31, 30 November 2020 (UTC) [32]. It's a nutshell version of something I've said, in various words, many times since the late 2000s.) As of right this moment, Wikipedia (the encyclopedic content, excluding other material like talk pages) is calculable to be approximately 89.31 times the size of Encyclopædia Britannica. (The bulk of the math is from User:Tompw/bookshelf/assumptions, but at the time it only calculated how many volumes of EB would be filled by WP.) "WP is a bad place to engage in labelling that isn't absolutely integral to international public perception of the subject." (In an essay/tutorial at WT:Categorization, 15:39, 9 June 2018 (UTC) [33]. Someone suggested[34] framing it on their wall! The idea eventually developed into the essay WP:Race and ethnicity.)

(At WT:Manual of Style, 16:49, 24 December 2017 (UTC) [35]. This was in the context of readers wanting to verify our content with claim-by-claim inline citations not "general references". Someone else nominated it as a mot juste and "a gem" [36]. It was later quoted on someone's user page [37] along with one by Stephen Fry and another by Neil Gaiman. Pretty good company; I'm honored.) "A disambiguation that introduces another ambiguity is a failure." (I say this frequently. I'm not aware of anyone quoting me on it verbatim, but I've seen a rise in the same argument made in other words, and it is having the desired effect on article titles debates at WP:Requested moves. "If MoS does not already have a rule on something, then it almost certainly doesn't need one." (Included as a corollary at EEng's "If MOS does not need to have a rule on something, then it needs to not have a rule on that thing" essay. "No line item in our Manual of Style is supported by 100% of editors, and no editor supports 100% of its line items. The same situation is true of all style guides and their scopes and audiences in the wider world. The purpose of a stylebook is to set some ground rules (often arbitrary) so that the ballgame of writing can continue instead of the players standing around on the field brawling about trivia." (Summary of what I've said in variant wording probably 100 times in style disputes. No one ever tries to refute it. This awareness is what keeps our MoS from being a nightmare of editwarring about specific rules, over-inclusion of rules we don't need, deletion of ones we do just because someone doesn't like them, and pretense that no rules are needed.) "The next-to-last resort of someone who cannot muster a rational response to an opposing argument is to wave away that argument as something impossible to respond to (the last resort being ad hominem attacks)." (In particular, if you say "TL;DR" to refuse to respond to a cogent argument because it takes work to do so, you are at the wrong site ??? this one consists almost entirely of millions of pages of detailed and particular text, so if you can't parse a few paragraphs you are incompetent to work on this project.) "If one grinds an axe long and hard enough, there is no axe any longer, just a useless old stick." (A quasi-Taoist response to cranky complaints that relate to incidents so long ago no one should care any more. Compressed version: "Grind axe too long: no axe.") "Two words: tea pot. ~~~~" (A response to angry accusations of wrong-doing that self-evidently apply at least equally and usually much more accurately to the ranter. More recently, I've used it as a mantra for myself, when I feel wikistressed. It eventually led to the WP:HOTHEADS essay.) Nifty Wikipedia tools[edit] Kind of hard to find unless you already know about them: Resources[edit] Wikimedia Labs at Mediawiki.org, for general info. The Tool Labs at WikiTech.Wikimedia.org, where anyone can create an account to develop tools. This page indicates lost tools and other problems after the demise of the old ToolServer. OAuth applications list Stats tools[edit] Xtools-articleinfo at WMFLabs (general page stats, by year and month, with charts, etc.) editorinteract.py at WMFLabs – analyzes your interaction with one or more other users Mathbot's Tool – how often a user uses "Edit summary" Aka's Page History Stats Tool – edit-related stats on any article or other page TDS's Article Contribution Counter – get stats (with some accuracy lag, usually a few weeks) on who the top editors of an article are Interiot's StubSense - what stubs are being used in a category Interiot's Related Changes Watchlist – makes "Special:Recentchangeslinked" pages behave like watchlists Internal tools[edit] Special:AllMessages ??? track down any system message/notice (e.g. copyright warnings you are tired of seeing and want to exclude in your WP:USERCSS.) Advanced Search of Wikipedia Editing tools[edit] This user cites sources using refToolbar WP:WikEd – syntax-highlighting WP editor (integrated, not external) WP:RefToolbar 2.0 – reference citation tool Coding tools[edit] Special:ExpandTemplates – get raw HTML output of arbitrary wikicode with templates and parserfunctions Lua programming and Scribunto modules Wikipedia:Lua Module:Arguments meta:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions – the hard-to-find full ParserFunctions (template code) documentation Cleanup tools[edit] Reference citation consistency checker (use in sandbox or talk page): {{ref info|Manx cat|style=float:right}} Visualization tools[edit] vCat ??? a tool to generate Graphviz diagrams of Wikipedia category relationships. Examples: https://tools.wmflabs.org/vcat/render?wiki=enwiki&category=Cue_sports ??? Show the entire parent and other "ancestor" category tree structure of Category:Cue sports (up to the maximum of 250 nodes) https://tools.wmflabs.org/vcat/render?wiki=enwiki&category=Cue_sports&depth=2 ??? Show just the immediate parent and grandparent categories of Category:Cue sports https://tools.wmflabs.org/vcat/render?wiki=enwiki&category=Cue_sports&depth=4&algorithm=fdp ??? Show four levels but as node clusters instead of a tree https://tools.wmflabs.org/vcat/render?wiki=enwiki&category=Cue_sports&rel=subcategory - Show the immediate child subcategories of Category:Cue sports (this function does not recurse and show child sub-sub-categories, etc.) https://tools.wmflabs.org/vcat/render?wiki=enwiki&category=Cue_sports&rel=subcategory&algorithm=fdp - Show the same, but as a ring graph instead of a tree https://tools.wmflabs.org/vcat/render?wiki=enwiki&title=William_A._Spinks&depth=2&algorithm=fdp - Show a node-cluster ring graph of the parent and grandparent categories of the article William A. Spinks There are various other options, such as: creating links in the graph to the categories shown, or to new graphs starting at those categories; specifying output image format; outputting a text Graphviz .gv file with no node limit, for local rendering; choosing a different wiki, like French Wikipedia, or Wiktionary (example), or Commons; etc. Help and info[edit] WP:Editor's index to Wikipedia wikipedia-en-help channel at FreeNode Editor interaction analysis[edit] Editor Interaction Analyzer by Sigma, compares the edits of two to three specified editors to see which articles overlap, sorted by minimum time between edits by both users. Only works on the English Wikipedia. Speed: slow. Intersect Contribs, compares the edits of two to eight editors at any WMF wiki to see which articles overlap. Speed: fast. Intertwined contributions, merges the contributions of two editors at any WMF wiki into a single list. Speed: fast. Unsorted additions[edit] Help:Labeled section transclusion ??? comparatively new feature that most of us don't know how to use yet How to ping people: "The keys are: max 20 pings per edit; and do an edit to clean before before trying a new ping, so the system sees a clean diff; and of course always new four-tilde signature. Dicklyon (talk) 03:45, 15 December 2014 (UTC)" CatScan category analysis tool CatScan Quick Intersection TimedMediaHandler - a-v in articles Find which Wiki pages link to a particular site [38] List changes made recently to pages linked from a specified page [39] Readability meter [40] Wikichecker [41] Emoticons [42] Tools for analysis of local MediaWiki installations (not directly relevant for en.wikipedia) Magnus's Reference Generator – auto-format several kinds of source citations Outdated due to the demise of the ToolServer Search through a page's history for edits made by a particular user [43] List contributors to an article, ranked in order of activity [44] Find images for a given article, using interwiki links [45] What pages have you and another edited?

Just of use on project and user pages, of course. We don't do stuff like this in articles. User:Kudpung/RfA advice html experiment ??? Derp! As of 2019,[update] this layout no longer works right due to changes in MediaWiki. Maybe the page will get fixed. Nevertheless, you can still get an idea what it used to do properly.
