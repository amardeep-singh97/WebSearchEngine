Category:Redirects to category space - Wikipedia Help Category:Redirects to category space From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For more information, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Redirect and Help:Redirect. The pages in this category are redirects from pages outside the category namespace to pages inside the category namespace. To add a redirect to this category, place {{Rcat shell|{{R to category namespace}}}} on the second new line (skip a line) after #REDIRECT [[Target page name]]. For more information follow the links. Never substitute redirect template(s), nor place them on soft redirects. See also the complete list of redirect templates and the redirect style guide. This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance ??? show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). Pseudo-namespace redirects and cross-namespace redirects are helpful for creating shortcuts. It is not necessary to replace redirected links with a piped link. Redirect pages in category space are soft redirects, and redirect category templates (rcats) must never be used to tag soft redirects.
