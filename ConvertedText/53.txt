WikiProjects and Task Forces WikiProject Sweep, which aims to comprehensively review every article created in Wikipedia's early days to ensure basic conformity to modern standards, has been launched following a successful proposal at the WikiProject Council. The Wikipedia Help Project seeks assistance expanding and improving the Task Center and other pages within the Help namespace. WikiProject Abandoned Drafts Stale draft drive. An ongoing drive dedicated to reducing the amount of stale user space drafts. Options are to delete, redirect, move to mainspace or blank. Stop by and help the drive out! WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia is looking for people who are interested in helping out in our project to get our articles into an audio format that can be used for any number of uses including, but not limited to, visually impaired or people who just prefer to listen to the article instead of reading it for whatever reason they choose. You can sign up here on our participant's page. We are also in need of native or fluent speakers so that everything is pronounced properly. You can sign up for the Pronunciation task force by adding your name as well as your languages of fluency to section 2. Technical news This section is transcluded from Template:Latest tech news. (edit | history) Group efforts and monthly projects Monthly projects Guild of Copy Editors' editing drive. The July 2021 backlog drive is a one-month-long effort of the Guild of Copy Editors to reduce the backlog of articles that require copy editing; those carrying the {{copy edit}} tag (also {{awkward}}, {{copy edit section}}, {{inappropriate person}}, and {{copy edit inline}} and their redirects) or listed on the GOCE Requests page. It began on 1 July 2021, 00:00 (UTC) and ends on 31 July 2021, 23:59 (UTC). Good Article Nominations backlog drive runs from 1 July 2021, 00:00 (UTC) and ends on 31 July 2021, 23:59 (UTC). This is a monthlog effort to cut the number of outstanding GANs and in particular those which have been in the queue 90 days or more. Awards will be given out to those individuals who do the most work in helping reduce the size of the backlog and reach milestones related to the number, age, and size, of articles reviewed. Ongoing group efforts The 100,000 Challenge. The quest to bring about 100,000 article improvements and creations globally through a series of 50,000/10,000/1000 Challenges for different regions and countries. This is a loose challenge, a list will not be maintained here, but the components will function independently on each of the subpages. Will be updated every week or two. The 50,000 Destubbing Challenge is a long term challenge to destub 50,000 articles on English Wikipedia for every country and topic. It may take decades to accomplish, it may take ten years, it all depends on how many people actively contribute. Page used for announcements towards the community members of the project Wikipedia:WikiCup. The WikiCup is a championship that has taken place every year on Wikipedia since 2007. The Cup is played and won by skill of editing. The purpose of the Cup is to encourage content creation and improvement and make editing on Wikipedia more fun. There is a new round every month, until the current contest ends; below are the details. May 1 to June 28 ??? 32 contestants left. July 1 to August 29 ??? 16 contestants left. September 1 to October 31 ??? 8 finalists left, the contestant with the highest score will win! WP:The Core Contest is a recurring six-week contest, starting on June 1 in 2021. The purpose is to give a boost to Wikipedia's most important articles, especially those that start out in a bad shape. Monthly contest, WikiProject Military history. The contest department of the Military history WikiProject aims to motivate increased quality in military history articles by offering a form of friendly competition for project members making improvements to them. The primary contest available is a simple rolling competition that awards points for improving articles. The contest runs from the first to last day of each month. WikiProject Medicine Collaboration of the Month. Every month, a topic will be selected from this page that will be the focus of editing for some members of Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine. The article may or may not yet exist. Topics may either relate to medical basic sciences (anatomy, biochemistry, and so on), or clinical medicine (illnesses, surgical procedures, and so on).

How to use red links When a link in Wikipedia leads to nowhere, it is displayed in red to alert our editors that it requires attention. A red link can mean one of two things: The link is broken and no longer leads to an article (perhaps because the underlying article was deleted). In such a case, the link needs to be removed or renamed to point to an existing article. A new article is needed. When a Wikipedian writes an article, it is common practice to linkify key topics pertinent to an understanding of the subject, even if those topics don't have an article on Wikipedia yet. This has two applications: From within an article, such a link prepares the article to be fully supported. At any time, a Wikipedian may independently write an article on the linked-to subject, and when this happens, there's already a link ready and waiting for it. The red link also gives readers the opportunity to click on it to create the needed article on the spot. In topic lists, it is useful to include every topic on the subject you can possibly find or think of. When they are turned into links, the list immediately shows where the gaps in Wikipedia's coverage for that subject are, since all of the topics missing articles will show up in red. Such lists are useful tools in developing subject areas on Wikipedia, as they show where work is needed most.
