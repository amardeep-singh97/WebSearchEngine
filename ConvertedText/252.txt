Template:R to project namespace - Wikipedia Template:R to project namespace From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search When used with the "Redirect category shell" (Rcat shell) template: This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized. Template {{Redirect category shell}} may be used to add one or more rcat templates, along with their parameters and categories, to a redirect. For more information see the documentation page below. When used by itself: To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space. Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space.

Thank you! Shortcut {{R to project}} Purpose This redirect category (rcat) template sorts redirect pages into one of two categories: Category:Redirects to project space ??? for pseudo-namespace redirects (PNRs) (for example, MOS:) and cross-namespace redirects (CNRs), or Category:Redirects to Wikipedia project pages ??? for project namespace redirects (for example, Wikipedia: or its shortcut, WP:) to other project pages This rcat template also populates the following: 3. Category:Unprintworthy redirects ??? only redirects from main-article namespace (mainspace) In 2003, efforts were begun to support the Wikimedia Foundation's goal of increasing access and availability of Wikipedia articles in printed versions. Mainspace redirects that target pages in the Wikipedia project namespace are not suitable for a printed version. In other words, they are unprintworthy. Please do not alter the printworthy settings of this rcat without first notifying the Version 1.0 Editorial Team, who are responsible for any and all materials, including redirects, that go into a printed version of Wikipedia. Usage Use this rcat template in any namespace including project (Wikipedia) namespace. Apply this rcat template to a redirect page by using the following wikitext: #REDIRECT [[Wikipedia:(target page name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R to project namespace}}
}}
 and when the redirect is in article mainspace, printworthiness should also be tagged: #REDIRECT [[Wikipedia:(target page name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R to project namespace}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
}}
 Template {{Rcat shell}} is an alias for the Redirect category shell template, which may be used to add as many appropriate rcat templates and their parameters as needed to a redirect, usually from one to seven. For more information, see the documentation on its template page. This rcat may also tag a redirect individually: #REDIRECT [[Wikipedia:(target page name)]]

{{R to project namespace}}
 This is in accord with instructions found at Wikipedia:REDCAT. Use this rcat template to tag any redirect page to a page in the project (Wikipedia: or WP:) namespace, whether the redirect page itself is in project namespace or in any other namespace. These redirect pages will automatically be sorted as either inside or outside of project namespace.
