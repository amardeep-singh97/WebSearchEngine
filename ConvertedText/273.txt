Wikipedia:Did you know/Fivefold - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Did you know/Fivefold From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Wikipedia:Did you know Jump to navigation Jump to search This is part of the Learning DYK system Main Main page Site map One page Glossary Article New article Not exactly Fivefold explanation Meanies Article length DYKcheck Citation You knew this Nomination Sources for DYK articles Hook format length multiple articles Image Submission After nominating Other Proofreading Approval Preparation areas Lore v t e Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/New article Shortcuts WP:DYKFN WP:5X F1: Former redirects, stubs, or other short articles in which the prose portion (not the whole article) has been expanded fivefold or more within the last seven days since nomination (well, not exactly), are acceptable as "new" articles. The content with which the article has been expanded must be new content, not text copied from other articles. For step-by-step guide on how to calculate whether the expansion is big enough and recent enough, see User:Rjanag/Calculating fivefold expansion by hand. F2: Fivefold expansion means at least five times as much prose as the previously existing article ??? no matter how bad it was (copyvios are an exception), no matter whether you kept any of it, and no matter if it was up for deletion. This may be a bad surprise, but we don't have enough time and volunteers to reach consensus on the quality of each previous article. F3: "Seven days old" means seven days old in article space. You may write your article on a user subpage and perfect it for months. The seven days start when you move it into article space. Such moves are often overlooked when enforcing the seven day rule, so we may need a reminder. But if you move the edit history along with the article, we might not believe you moved it, because it isn't obvious in the edit history. F4: If some of the text was copied from another Wikipedia article, then it must be expanded fivefold as if the copied text had been a separate article. F5: The age of the previously existing article used to calculate fivefold expansion depends on the date of the next version, not the date that version was created. Explanation here. F6: The fivefold rule is controversial.
