"It???s almost impossible to imagine life without Wikipedia" Godwin, Richard (February 22, 2018). "Why Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is the good guy of tech". Evening Standard. "If Wikipedia is good enough for the Archivist of the United States, maybe it should be good enough for you." Wikimania 2012 Closing Plenary by David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, see especially (15:00-16:00), and (22:50 - end). "???If we want to get high-quality information to all the world???s population, Wikipedia is not just a viable option, but the only viable option.??? Dr. Amin Azzam, professor at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine on assigning medical students to write Wikipedia articles, quoted in the New York Times "Wikipedia is more important as an information resource than any other single institution. We need to accept that and figure out how to work with it." The Kinetic Museum, (11:00-11:15), Koven J. Smith, August, 2012 "Wikipedia is the best approximation of a complete account of knowledge we???ve ever seen. "It???s also the most robust. The most easily accessed. And the safest. It exists on servers around the world so, unlike the library at Alexandria, it can???t be burned down." Emily Dreyfuss, Wired, October 10, 2014 "At any given moment, right now, if you go to Wikipedia you're going to find the most comprehensive article on Barack Obama. You're not going to find it on the Washington Post or the New York Times, you're going to find it on Wikipedia. Why? Because all of these people care about information have gone there to edit it and re-edit it and add as much information as they can."
