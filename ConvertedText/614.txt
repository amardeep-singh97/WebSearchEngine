Template:R to anchor - Wikipedia Template:R to anchor From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search When used with the "Redirect category shell" (Rcat shell) template: This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect: To an embedded anchor: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to an embedded anchor on the redirect's target page. An {{anchor|(anchor name)}} template, a <span id="(anchor name)"> html element, or an |id=(anchor name) parameter might be installed at the beginning of a paragraph, in or near a section header or within a table. The anchor might also be an old section header that has been edited and is anchored within or near the new header to prevent broken internal and external links. Even though section headers of the general form ==(Header name)== are themselves a type of anchor, use {{R to section}} instead. When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized. Template {{Redirect category shell}} may be used to add one or more rcat templates, along with their parameters and categories, to a redirect. For more information see the documentation page below.

Template documentation[view] [edit] [history] [purge] This template is used on approximately 52,000 pages and changes may be widely noticed. Test changes in the template's /sandbox or /testcases subpages, or in your own user subpage. Consider discussing changes on the talk page before implementing them. This template should not be substituted nor used to tag soft redirects. If you plan to make breaking changes to this template, move it, or nominate it for deletion, please notify Twinkle's users and maintainers at Wikipedia talk:Twinkle as a courtesy, as this template is used in the standard installation of Twinkle. Thank you! Usage Use this rcat template in any namespace. This redirect category (rcat) template populates Category:Redirects to embedded anchors. Add this rcat to a redirect in the following manner: #REDIRECT [[(target page name)#(target anchor name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R to anchor}}
}}
 and when the redirect is in article mainspace, printworthiness should also be tagged: #REDIRECT [[(target page name)#(target anchor name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R to anchor}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
}}
 Template {{Rcat shell}} is an alias for the Redirect category shell template, which may be used to add as many appropriate rcats as needed, usually from one to seven, along with their parameters, to a redirect. For more information see the documentation on its template page. This rcat may also tag a redirect individually: #REDIRECT [[(target page name)#(target anchor name)]]

{{R to anchor}}
 This is in accord with instructions found at Wikipedia:REDCAT. This rcat is used whenever a redirect targets an embedded {{anchor}} on a page, a <span id=(anchor)> ... </span> html element or the id= attribute within tables. A redirect may target an anchor that covers a particular term that has insufficient independent scope and notability to warrant its own section, much less an entire article, and the term is nonetheless important within the field and is useful to link from other articles in the field of expertise. Such redirects allow a reader to search and find useful information about the term and similar related material in the defining article. Also use this rcat to tag redirects that target old section headers that have been replaced and anchored to prevent broken internal and external links. This template should not be used to categorize redirects to existing section headers. Use {{R to section}} instead. Please use the following rcats when more appropriate: {{R to list entry}}, which populates Category:Redirects to list entries {{R to section}}, which populates Category:Redirects to sections Aliases Also known as... ??? list of templates that redirect here and may also be used Printworthiness Please do not alter the printworthy settings of this rcat without first notifying the Version 1.0 Editorial Team, who are responsible for any and all materials, including redirects, that go into a printed version of Wikipedia. In main-article namespace, many redirects to embedded anchors are considered printworthy, perhaps even with the possibility to become a separate article, project page, etc.; however, there are many other such redirects that are unprintworthy, so there is no default sort for printworthiness. In 2003, efforts were begun to support the Wikimedia Foundation's goal of increasing access and availability of Wikipedia articles in printed versions. Some rcats automatically populate either Category:Printworthy redirects or Category:Unprintworthy redirects by default. Others, like this rcat, do not, and that means it is up to editors to choose which of those categories, Printworthy or Unprintworthy, is appropriate and should be populated. The rcats that are used separately to populate those categories are: {{R printworthy}} and {{R unprintworthy}} Please click on each one for more details and guidance. Template {{Redirect category shell}} will accept these rcats just like any other. Examples: {{Rcat shell|
{{R to anchor}}
{{R printworthy}}
}}

{{Rcat shell|
{{R to anchor}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
