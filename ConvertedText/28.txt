We are a group of editors who aim to streamline and co-ordinate the expansion of train-related articles. If you would like to join the project, simply add your name to the list of participants. Please browse our resources at your leisure; we hope you find them useful. Recent changes in rail transport-related articles (list) Goals To create the foremost reliable and accurate free-content encyclopedia of trains in the English language. To improve coverage of trains by creating, expanding, and maintaining articles that describe all of its aspects. To provide guidelines and recommendations for such articles, and to serve as the central point of discussion for issues related to trains in Wikipedia. Scope The project generally considers any article related to historical or contemporary train-related affairs to be within its scope. A more detailed description of the scope, and our primary areas of focus within it, may be found in the section on project scope. Structure The project aims solely to assist the authoring of reliable and accurate trains articles in accordance with our Goals [above]. Internally, the project had developed several structural features to assist in the management of our workload: Task forces: informal groups for collaboration on specific train-related topics. Departments: areas of the project which streamline work???such as article review and outside opinions???that "supports" the main body of article writers. General discussion relating to this project takes place on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Trains; suggestions or comments are welcome there.
