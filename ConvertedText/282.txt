Wikipedia:Did you know/Hook - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Did you know/Hook From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Wikipedia:Did you know Jump to navigation Jump to search This is part of the Learning DYK system Main Main page Site map One page Glossary Article New article Not exactly Fivefold explanation Meanies Article length DYKcheck Citation You knew this Nomination Sources for DYK articles Hook format length multiple articles Image Submission After nominating Other Proofreading Approval Preparation areas Lore v t e Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Nomination Shortcuts WP:DYKHN WP:HOOK A hook is what you see, several times, in the Main Page's Did You Know section. Each hook begins with "...". H1: The hook should be formatted like the hooks you see on the Main Page. Checklist here. H2: The hook itself should be concise (fewer than about 200 characters, including spaces). More details here. H3: The hook should refer to established facts that are not likely to change, and should be relevant for more than just novelty or newness. H4: The hook should be neutral. H5: The "Did you know?" fact must be mentioned in the article and cited with an inline citation to a reliable source since inline citations are used to support specific statements in an article. A lot of submissions are made which fail to meet one or both of these criteria. Nominators should ensure that their submissions meet both of these criteria or their submissions will fail DYK eligibility. H6: Articles and hooks which focus on negative aspects of living individuals should be avoided. H7: When you write the DYK item (or "hook") please make it "hooky", that is, short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article. An interesting hook is more likely to draw in a variety of readers. Shorter hooks are preferred to longer ones, as long as they don't misstate the article content. H8: Once again, you need a new, qualifying article, not just a hook, no matter how interesting the hook is. H9: Piping the article link is sometimes discouraged, but many hooks are better when the link is piped, and show on the Main Page that way. Disambiguated article titles like Gene Green (baseball) are always piped like this: '''[[Gene Green (baseball)|Gene Green]]'''. H10: Don't falsely assume that everyone worldwide knows what country or sport you're talking about. H11: If the subject is a work of fiction or a fictional character, the hook must involve the real world in some way. H12: No links to disambiguation pages. Here is the Wikipedia guideline. H13: If the hook uses a possessive apostrophe after the qualifying article, use {{`}} or {{`s}} to keep the bold text and the apostrophe distinct e.g. "... that John's house (etc)?" If the article is in italics (e.g. a ship's name), use the slightly different templates {{'}} or {{'s}} e.g. "... that HMS Hood's anchor (etc)?"
