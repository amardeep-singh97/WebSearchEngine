(See Help:Wikitext for wiki equivalents to HTML tags not otherwise discussed below.) And HTML is useful outside of articles, for example for formatting within templates. For help with Cascading Style Sheet use within Wikipedia see Help:Cascading Style Sheets. Some tags look like HTML, but are actually MediaWiki parser and extension tags, and so are really wiki markup. HTML in pages can be checked for HTML5 compliance by using validation. Some elements and attributes are supported by MediaWiki and browsers, but have been deprecated by HTML 5, and therefore should no longer be used.

For further assistance and detailed specifications: HTML5 Introduction at developer.mozilla.org HTML5 Introduction at w3schools.com Attributes HTML attributes provide additional information about an element and are always specified in the start tag. They are formatted as a name/value pair like name="value". Global attributes apply to all tags. Attributes not listed here are not allowed by MediaWiki[1]: class: one or more classifications to which the element belongs. See Wikipedia:Catalogue of CSS classes. dir: text direction??? "ltr" (left-to-right), "rtl" (right-to-left) or "auto". id: unique identifier for the element. lang: primary language for the contents of the element per BCP 47. style: applies CSS styling to the contents of the element. title: advisory information associated with the element. HTML5 microdata attributes apply to all tags:[2] Any attribute beginning with data- itemid itemprop itemref itemscope itemtype Other tags such as <table> support specific attributes ??? these are listed in the appropriate section. Markup Renders as This is <span style="color:red;">red</span> text.
 This is red text. The MediaWiki Sanitizer.php does some cleanup on attributes. A best practice is to use the proper syntax. Discards attributes not on a whitelist for the given element. Turns broken or invalid entities into plaintext. Double-quotes all attribute values. Attributes without values are given the name as value. Double attributes are discarded. Unsafe style attributes are discarded. Prepends space if there are attributes. Elements These HTML elements are supported by the MediaWiki software. This section gives a brief overview of the HTML element, an example, relevant wikimarkup and templates. Basic h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 Further information: Help:Section and MOS:HEAD The <h1>...</h1> through <h6>...</h6> tags are headings for the sections with which they are associated. <h1> is used for the article title. Headings are styled through CSS and added to the page's table of contents. Markup Renders as <h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>

Markup Renders as HyperText Markup Language

HyperText Markup Language HyperText Markup Language HyperText Markup Language <p>...</p> is especially useful in lists, for list items with multiple paragraphs: Markup Renders as * <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is another paragraph in the same item.</p>
* This is a different item.
 This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph in the same item. This is a different item. Note that the closing tag </p> is not strictly necessary for MediaWiki installations that output HTML 5 (such as Wikipedia). br Further information: Help:Line-break handling § <br />, and Wikipedia:Don't use line breaks <br> or <br /> inserts a line break. Both versions of the break are supported by HTML5. Using <br> without the / breaks syntax highlighting, so should be avoided. </br> is invalid. Markup Renders as HyperText<br />Markup Language HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{break}} adds multiple line breaks. {{crlf2}} adds a true carriage return and line feed. {{clear}} adds a break with styling to clear floating elements. {{plainlist}} creates an unbulleted list. hr Further information: WP:LINE <hr> or <hr /> represents a paragraph-level thematic break and presents as a horizontal rule. Markup Renders as <hr /> Wikimarkup: use ---- Markup Renders as ---- Templates: {{hr}} Comments Further information: WP:COMMENT <!--...--> formats the enclosed text as a hidden comment. Markup Renders as HyperText<!--Markup Language--> HyperText Be careful with spacing around comments. Surrounding a comment with blank lines will result in a blank paragraph, perceived as an extra two blank lines: Markup Renders as Content line 1

<!-- Comment -->

Content line 2 Content line 1 Content line 2 Formatting abbr <abbr>...</abbr> creates a tooltip to define an abbreviation or acronym that is displayed on mouse-over. Markup Renders as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> HTML Templates: {{abbr}} b Further information: MOS:BOLD <b>...</b> formats text stylistically offset from other text (bold) without conveying extra importance.

Markup Renders as <blockquote>HyperText Markup Language</blockquote> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{quote}}; supports pre-formatted attribution and source parameters. For other specialized quotation templates, see Category:Quotation templates. cite <cite>...</cite> contains the title of a work. This is a new definition in HTML5??? in the previous XML implementation <cite> was used to contain a citation or a reference to other sources. No formatting is applied when this tag is used. Markup Renders as <cite>HyperText Markup Language</cite> HyperText Markup Language <cite>...</cite> is generally not used directly in Wikipedia articles, and is often misused; see Wikipedia:HTML 5#cite for replacement instructions. code <code>...</code> formats a section of computer code. Styled with CSS through mediawiki.skinning/elements.less as a monospaced typeface with a grey background and border. Markup Renders as <code>HyperText Markup Language</code> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{code}} uses <syntaxhighlight>.

Markup Renders as <dfn>Definition</dfn> Definition Templates: {{dfn}} em Further information: MOS:ITALIC <em>...</em> represents a span of text with emphatic stress (i.e. semantic emphasis). In most browsers, it renders as italic. Markup Renders as <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{em}} i Further information: MOS:ITALIC <i>...</i> represents a span of text offset from its surrounding content without conveying any extra emphasis or importance, and for which the conventional typographic presentation is italic text. Markup Renders as <i>HyperText Markup Language</i> HyperText Markup Language Wikimarkup: Use '' to open and close italic text. Markup Renders as ''HyperText Markup Language'' HyperText Markup Language ins <ins>...</ins> indicates a range of text that has been added. Styled as underlined text. Used on talk pages to indicate refactored text; see WP:REDACT. Markup Renders as <ins>HyperText Markup Language</ins> HyperText Markup Language kbd <kbd>...</kbd> indicates user input such as keyboard input or voice commands. Markup Renders as Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> Press Enter Templates: {{kbd}} applies monospace styling, and a light-grey background to distinguish from code (<code>) and output (<samp> or {{samp}}). {{key press}} renders illustrated keys and keystrokes. mark <mark>...</mark> represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context. Marked text is formatted with a yellow background by default. Markup Renders as <mark>HyperText Markup Language</mark> HyperText Markup Language <mark style="background:lightblue;">HyperText Markup Language</mark> HyperText Markup Language Support: Not supported by Internet Explorer 8 and below. pre <pre>...</pre> element represents a block of preformatted text. In MediaWiki, <pre> is actually a parser tag and not HTML, but the function is the same. It also prevents the parsing of templates. Markup Renders as <pre>HyperText Markup Language</pre> HyperText Markup Language
 HTML entities <pre> parses HTML entities. If you want to escape this, replace & with &amp;, or use <source lang="text"> instead. Markup Renders as <pre>&amp;</pre> &
 <pre>&lt;</pre> <
 <pre>&amp;amp;</pre> &amp;
 <pre>&amp;lt;</pre> &lt;
 Templates: {{pre}} wraps text that overflows the page. {{pre2}} wraps or uses scrollbox. q <q>...</q> is used to mark a short quotation. There has been very little implementation of this element in Wikipedia yet. Markup Renders as <q>HyperText Markup Language</q> HyperText Markup Language MOS:QUOTATIONS says Wikipedia should instead use "", {{quote}}, or <blockquote>. rp, rt, ruby Further information: Ruby character <ruby>...</ruby> marks spans of phrasing content with ruby annotations. <rt>...</rt> marks the ruby text component of a ruby annotation; the ruby text shows in a reduced size over top of the normal characters. <rp>...</rp> is used to provide parentheses around a ruby text component of a ruby annotation, to be shown by user agents that don???t support ruby annotations. Browsers that do not support ruby characters will show the ruby text in normal size, enclosed in parentheses and after the normal content. Markup Renders as <ruby>
???<rp>(</rp><rt>??????</rt><rp>)</rp>
?<rp>(</rp><rt>?????????</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>
 ???(??????) ?(?????????) Templates: {{ruby}} {{ruby-ja}} for Japanese {{Ruby-zh-p}} for Chinese pinyin {{Ruby-zh-b}} for Chinese bopomofo s <s>...</s> is used to indicate content that is no longer accurate or relevant and that has been struck from the page. It is not appropriate when indicating document edits; to mark a span of text as having been removed from a document, use <del>. Markup Renders as <s>HyperText Markup Language</s> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{strikethrough}} samp <samp>...</samp> indicates sample output from a program or computing system. Examples include: output of a program, script, or Wikipedia template; status displays or audio announcements made by an app or device; file system directory listings and samples from them, such as paths and file names. Markup Renders as <samp>HyperText Markup Language</samp> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{samp}} applies monospace styling, and gives the text in dark grey to distinguish from code (<code>) and input (<kbd> or {{kbd}}). small Further information: WP:FONTSIZE <small>...</small> format small text. Markup Renders as <small>HyperText Markup Language</small> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{small}} uses <span style="font-size:85%;">. {{small}} is recommended over <small> since <small>...</small> has a semantic meaning that is for fine print, whereas {{small}} is purely stylistic. strong <strong>...</strong> formats a span of text with strong importance or unusual emphasis; in most browsers it renders as boldface. This should generally not be used in Wikipedia articles, per WP:Neutral point of view policy. See MOS:BOLD on use of this element and other boldfacing. Most semantic emphasis, including in quoted material, should be rendered with the <em> element. Markup Renders as <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{strong}} sub Further information: WP:SUBSCRIPT <sub>...</sub> formats a span of text as a subscript. Markup Renders as HyperText <sub>Markup Language</sub> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{sub}} (subscript text) {{subsub}} (subscript subscript text) {{ssub}} (subscript, small text) {{sup}} (superscript text) {{su}} (superscript subscript text) {{sup sub}} (textsup sub) {{e}} (1.23??104) sup Further information: WP:SUPSCRIPT <sup>...</sup> formats a span of text as a superscript.

Markup Renders as <u>HyperText Markup Language</u> HyperText Markup Language Templates: {{underline}} var Further information: MOS:ITALIC <var>...</var> formats text in italics to indicate a variable in a mathematical expression or programming context, or placeholder text that the reader is meant to mentally replace with some other literal value. Markup Renders as *<var>E</var>=<var>m</var>c<sup>2</sup> (c is a constant not a variable)
*<code><nowiki>{{</nowiki><var>TemplateName</var>|<var>parameter</var>=<var>value</var><nowiki>}}</nowiki></code>

Lists Further information: Help:List and MOS:LIST Do not leave blank lines between items in a list unless there is a reason to do so, since this causes the MediaWiki software to interpret each item as beginning a new list. dl, dt, dd <dl>...</dl>, <dt>...</dt> and <dd>...</dd> are used to create a description list (formerly definition list) with terms and descriptions. Terms are displayed in bold and descriptions are indented. Each term must include one or more descriptions. Markup Renders as <dl>
<dt>Term</dt>
<dd>Definition 1</dd>
<dd>Definition 2</dd>
</dl>
 Term Definition 1 Definition 2 Wikimarkup: <dt> is created using ; while automatically enclosed in <dl>...</dl>. <dd> is created using : for each value.

Obsolete/deprecated elements Main page: Wikipedia:HTML5 § Obsolete elements and attributes These elements are now obsolete and either deprecated or removed in HTML5, but still supported by browsers.[3] These tags either have an alternate tag or a template that replaces their function with CSS. See Wikipedia:HTML5 § Obsolete elements and attributes for more details on obsolete HTML parts and their replacements. center For centering tables, see Help:Table § Centering tables. <center>...</center> (obsolete) is used to center text elements. Templates: {{center}} uses CSS. font <font>...</font> (obsolete) is used to set the font size, font face and color of text. Templates: {{font}} uses CSS. rb <rb>...</rb> (obsolete) Used to mark base text in a ruby annotation For replacements, see: Help:HTML in wikitext#rp, rt, ruby strike <strike>...</strike> (obsolete) formats strike-through characters; use <s> instead. tt <tt>...</tt> (obsolete) formats text in a fixed-width font. Use <code>, <kbd> or <samp> instead. Templates: {{mono}} uses CSS. Unsupported elements These elements are not supported, but have equivalent wiki markup. Attempting to use any element not whitelisted by Sanitizer.php will result in the markup showing as plain text. a Further information: Help:Wiki markup § Links and URLs <a> is used to create links. Use the [[ ]] wikimarkup for internal/intrawiki links and interwiki links, and [ ] for external links. input Further information: mw:Extension:InputBox <input> is used to create forms. The <inputbox> extension tag is used to create a text box with a button. HTML Tidy HTML Tidy is an outdated HTML4 library that is slated for removal. Tidy parses the MediaWiki output and cleans it up to increase the likelihood that valid HTML4 is rendered. For example, with Tidy enabled, <br>, </br>, <br/>, <br.> all rendered as <br />. Tidy is not enabled for MediaWiki interface pages. Tidy was never perfect and has been known to introduce errors. Exceptions In some pages in the MediaWiki namespace, typically the short messages like button labels, HTML is not parsed, and tags will be exposed. User and sitewide CSS and JavaScript pages are interpreted as if inside a <pre> block. See Help:User style. Validation Main page: Help:Markup validation The MediaWiki software attempts to fix HTML errors, but it does not catch all of them. Where HTML is used, it is helpful to verify it with the W3C Markup Validation Service.
