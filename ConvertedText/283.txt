Specifically: I1: Entries should start with an ellipsis of exactly three full stops (periods) (not the ellipsis character ???) and a space. See WP:ELLIPSIS. I2: The hook (or in the unusual case of multiple sentences, only the hook's first sentence) should end with one question mark. That is because the implied "Did you know ..." grammatically makes the first sentence, and only the first sentence, into a question that needs a question mark. I3: Don't write "... That". That is, don't capitalize the first word after the ellipsis (usually "that") unless it's a proper noun. I4: The hook must link to a qualifying new article. I5: The title of the new article must be in bold. I6: If your article title appears unpiped in the hook, don't capitalize the first word unless it's part of a proper noun, even though that word is always capitalized in the article title. I7: No redlinks in the hook. I8: No space before the question mark. No period before the question mark. I9: No external links in the hook.
