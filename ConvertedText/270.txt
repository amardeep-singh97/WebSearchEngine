The following criteria are used to determine whether a nominated article is eligible for Did You Know: New – The first priority is to understand that the article must be new, because newness can't be fixed later. To make a long story short: At least 80% of the article must be new (seven days old or less) when the article is nominated. Long enough – The article must have at least 1,500 characters of prose ??? not the whole article, just prose. Citations – The article must be cited like this. Neutral – Articles on living individuals are carefully checked to ensure that no unsourced or poorly sourced negative material is included. Articles and hooks which focus unduly on negative aspects of living individuals should be avoided. Free of copyvio or plagiarism – Except for brief, clearly marked quotations, the article does not include material copied or closely paraphrased from copyrighted sources. Material taken from public domain or compatibly licensed sources is properly attributed in line with Wikipedia:Plagiarism. You knew this but – to settle arguments we wrote this stuff down. The next step is nominating your article for Did You Know. You can ask a Did You Know regular or see this list of Did You Know administrators, or you can nominate it yourself as described here.
