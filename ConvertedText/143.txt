Make your donation now - Wikimedia Foundation Make your donation now Jump to navigation Jump to search We ask you, humbly, to help. We'll get straight to the point: Today we ask you to defend Wikipedia's independence. We're a non-profit that depends on donations to stay online and thriving, but 98% of our readers don't give; they simply look the other way. If everyone who reads Wikipedia gave just a little, we could keep Wikipedia thriving for years to come. The price of a cup of coffee is all we ask. When we made Wikipedia a non-profit, people told us we???d regret it. But if Wikipedia were to become commercial, it would be a great loss to the world. Wikipedia is a place to learn, not a place for advertising. The heart and soul of Wikipedia is a community of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable, neutral information. We know that most people will ignore this message. But if Wikipedia is useful to you, please consider making a donation of ???100, ???200, ???300 or whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia.

We have about 400 staff and contractors to support a wide variety of projects, making your donation a great investment in a highly-efficient not-for-profit organization.
