This is a very problematic piece. Setting aside possibly WP:OUTING of several editors in it, it also contains an effective endorsement of major CANVASS violations (See also Talk:Isaac_Bashevis_Singer#Inappopriate_canvassing), encourages edit warring, and harassing and in general breaking Wikipedia policies or at least gaming them 'for the greater cause, is offensive towards pretty much all members of WP:POLAND in general (or Polish people, even) and towards User:Oliszydlowski in particular. I think the Signpost, in any writeup of this piece, should make it clear that it is a very problematic type of journalism, one that clearly takes a side that is incompatible with Wikipedia, and a de facto attack on our project. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 06:45, 7 June 2021 (UTC) Thank you for bringing this up, I hadn't looked at the article in question yet. We probably can't use it for the possible outing alone, even leaving aside all the other issues.--3family6 (Talk to me | See what I have done) 13:11, 7 June 2021 (UTC) Not for nothing, but it's also a syndicated opinion piece. This seems to make a good case for why we have WP:RSOPINION. ??? Mikehawk10 (talk) 01:50, 8 June 2021 (UTC) @Smallbones: I noticed [1]. I could try to write up my take on this piece? --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 07:44, 13 June 2021 (UTC) @Piotrus: it's probably better that I just say "no". I remember a previous dispute along this line that I just got sick of. There were lots of people on both sides who were arguing past each other in good faith and I decided that there was nothing I could do to help straighten out the mess. This topic looks ten times as serious IMHO. It's got very little to do with your side or the other side, and a lot more to do with my personal situation. If you want to pursue this at all, send me a very, very short e-mail requesting a confidential response. Smallbones(smalltalk) 14:19, 13 June 2021 (UTC) Humor column is ready for copyedit[edit] What it says on the tin! ^ Would welcome any additions beyond copyediting as well. :) Ganesha811 (talk) 01:48, 16 June 2021 (UTC) Special issue about Wikipedia (She Ji)[edit] Well, a half or a third is about Wikipedia, counting... Minor plug since it includes two pieces by me, and one by User:Pundit (if the other authors have Wikipedia accounts, I am not familiar with them and can't ping them, sadly). Well, Ken Friedman, the journal editor who initiated this research project, had an account but is no longer active. Open access here https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/she-ji-the-journal-of-design-economics-and-innovation/vol/7/issue/2 Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 07:58, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks, we'll make sure to mention these in "Recent research" (I also just tweeted them from @WikiResearch). Btw interesting to read professor Friedman's research finding that "As a commercial venture, with taxes and business costs to pay, [Wikipedia] might well collapse." PS: Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/Newsroom/Suggestions is the default location for tips. Regards, HaeB (talk) 14:36, 25 June 2021 (UTC) HaeB, Thanks. I think his piece is interesting and valuable, but the sentence you quote is more of speculation (untested hypothesis...) than a research finding. Just a nitpick :P Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 06:16, 26 June 2021 (UTC) HaeB, PS. I assume they'll be mentioned in the new issue, since today's doesn't do so? Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 05:37, 28 June 2021 (UTC) I've put them on our todo list. They will definitely be covered, but when and at what length depends on how many folks volunteer to do writeups ;) Regards, HaeB (talk) 08:41, 28 June 2021 (UTC) Publishing should be on schedule[edit] I think there will be 11 articles, so all copy editors will be needed! Smallbones(smalltalk) 04:18, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Smallbones, great! Thoughts on the Wikinews submission? Ganesha811 (talk) 13:56, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Also, if there's any particular article you'd like to assign me to copyedit, I'm happy to! Ganesha811 (talk) 13:57, 26 June 2021 (UTC) @Ganesha811, Bri, and Isaacl: As usual, I'm running late with the stories I'm writing. But In the media is ready for CE but the Video and podcast section will need to be updated. Unfortunately, with two months of material, I've had to remove some - so no more stories there. Humour is ready for CE News from the WMF just needs some formatting - CE should be limited to very obvious spelling and grammar mistakes, since it's been published elsewhere already Traffic report is always a challenge for me -the June sections (near the bottom( could use a 2nd or 3rd set of eyes). Note that the authors have their own style, which we need to respect, but occasionally it does get a bit convoluted. Word choice can be a bit odd at times - but please take the time to think it through before changing. One thing that's really my job is checking to see if any WP rules have been broken, particularly WP:BLP. Any help there appreciated. Please leave the obit alone for now. Obits can be a minefield - this one in particular. Recent research is almost always the last submission - right on the deadline. @HaeB: is a former Signpost EiC, so he knows what he is doing. But I check quickly just to make sure he hasn't lost his glasses or unintentional included his file on my life history. There will be more. Smallbones(smalltalk) 15:14, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Smallbones, ok! I've copyedited News from the WMF (very minor changes) and the June section of the traffic report (slightly more substantial changes). Ganesha811 (talk) 16:08, 26 June 2021 (UTC) We're doing pretty well. There are just 3 more articles to come. 1 I'm having 2nd thoughts, nut pretty much have to publish it. 2 Disinformation report - one section to go, plus checking out another source that may add a bit here and there. Done in 2 hours. 3 News and notes - not really started yet. There are about 5 stories to go in there. Feel free to start a section and take a shot. @Ganesha811: thanks for your work on Traffic report. The pic you changed got removed as non-free by a bot, so I put the old one back. We can't use non-free images on The Signpost because we're not in mainspace. As far as removing material, I'm agnostic on most of those. Some folks come down more on one side or the other in Israeli-Palestinian matters. I try to avoid getting caught in the middle. I'll ping @Bri and Igordebraga: to see if they agree with your changes. Like I said Traffic report can be a challenge. Smallbones(smalltalk) 19:01, 26 June 2021 (UTC) If you are talking about this then yes, I found the original distasteful and it stuck out as picking sides. But I don???t know what our editorial policy is on material we pick up from other portions of project space. ??? Bri (talk) 19:13, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Bri, Smallbones yes, I struck out some material related to Israel-Palestine. I have strong opinions on the issue myself, but I really don't see the point raising the conflict in such an opinionated way in the Traffic Report - it gains us controversy and discord in exchange for no benefit to anyone. Thanks for the note on the image, didn't know that rule. Ganesha811 (talk) 19:58, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks @Bri and Ganesha811:. I don't know that we have a specific policy on outside (previously published) material. I do check things before I go out and ask somebody if they want to reprint something here. With Traffic report it's a bit different, since they've been publishing here a long time. If I'm not sure about something there, I tend to ping Igordebraga. Note that he doesn't write everything there, but as far as I'm concerned, he's in charge of the submission. So same rules for TR as anybody else, taking into account their stylistic differences. But this doesn't come in under "style". If Igordebraga doesn't get back to us, or if he agrees with you that the material is offensive, then it stays out. If he disagrees, I'll look at it again. Smallbones(smalltalk) 20:31, 26 June 2021 (UTC) @Smallbones: Just noticed the same passage has been edited in the published Top25 Report. I will copy-paste it into ours. Disregard, it still has issues. Self-reverted. ??? Bri (talk) 21:36, 26 June 2021 (UTC) OK Disinformation report and Forum are ready for CE. Feel free to email me if you have general discussion on these I should get to News and notes tonight, but feel free to help. Smallbones(smalltalk) 22:48, 26 June 2021 (UTC) Smallbones, ok, I've copyedited the Forum. Did Kolbe have anything else to add after your last comments? How did the discussion end? Ganesha811 (talk) 23:08, 26 June 2021 (UTC) We agreed that I had the last edit. If he objects to anything, he's got my email. I think I'll take the bolded intro off the top - do you think we're being too nasty? Smallbones(smalltalk) 00:08, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Smallbones, if you'd like. Neither of you were shy about your opinions, and while I definitely wouldn't want to edit your words (or his), I figured it was worth having an additional clarification that a vigorous exchange of ideas is what the Forum column is for. Ganesha811 (talk) 01:35, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Should be ready in about 4 hours[edit] @DannyS712 and HaeB: we should be ready to go on timr in about 4 hours. I'm still working on News and notes, so could use some help and copy editing there. I'll update the CE status soon, with one request - lots of people are very sensitive about the obit, It looks like is in equilibrium now, but please *don't* copy edit it now. Smallbones(smalltalk) 15:52, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks - "Recent research" will morph into a publishable shape before 20:00 UTC. Regards, HaeB (talk) 16:21, 27 June 2021 (UTC) @Smallbones: I'll be ready to publish, just let me know which order to put the articles in DannyS712 (talk) 19:14, 27 June 2021 (UTC) @DannyS712: Thanks - the order can be approx, the same as in The Newsroom. The only absolute is that the OBIT is last as always - a place of honor and always easy to find . Smallbones(smalltalk) 19:21, 27 June 2021 (UTC) @DannyS712: Ready to publish! Back in 10 minutes. Smallbones(smalltalk) 20:07, 27 June 2021 (UTC) @Smallbones: Doing... DannyS712 (talk) 20:08, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Sent --DannyS712 (talk) 20:15, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Fantastic @DannyS712: You are accurate and fast too! I think we're all done here! Smallbones(smalltalk) 20:27, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks everybody[edit] It looks like it could be a good issue. We'll see what the readers think. Special thanks for DannyS712 for publishing. You all should watch your article to respond to comments. Thanks Smallbones(smalltalk) 20:46, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Smallbones, everyone else, congrats on another issue. :) By the way, I haven't gotten a notification on my watchlist page yet - has that been sent? Ganesha811 (talk) 21:26, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Just got it, nevermind! Ganesha811 (talk) 21:46, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Reader feedback[edit] View reader feedback on issue 5 (June) All: You can use the button above to monitor feedback on the June 27 issue. ??? Bri (talk) 21:13, 27 June 2021 (UTC) Passing of Sherwin Siy[edit] https://twitter.com/wikimedia/status/1413248809099055109 meta:User:SSiy (WMF) https://diff.wikimedia.org/2021/06/22/foundation-360-protecting-work-wikimedia-editors-public-policy/ https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/internet-loses-champion-passing-sherwin-siy https://www.law.gwu.edu/sherwin-siy https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-mourns-the-loss-of-sherwin-siy/ Sherwin Siy, Lead Public Policy Manager of the Wikimedia Foundation, died on Wednesday 7 July 2021. On Facebook his sibling said that he died "while having a great time on a vacation with friends". I posted on his meta page. meta:User_talk:SSiy_(WMF)#Sherwin_is_passed Sherwin had many professional relationships and Wikimedia projects, but I am unaware of most of them. I knew Sherwin to be a strong supporter of Wikimedia LGBT+ and an advocate of safety for vulnerable online user communities. Wikimedia LGBT+ is a small distributed community and losing a friend and advocate in the Wikimedia Foundation is a major setback the growth of community infrastructure and projects. I am unsure how anyone will immediately reflect on his life, but I wanted to post here to say that among other memories, he supported our LGBT+ community. I would like to get a brief obituary for him but I am pausing a bit because I knew his minor but significant LGBT+ activities, but I am unaware of his major projects. If anyone steps up to describe his main projects then those should be the focus. Being a lawyer doing off-wiki advocacy, it might be the case that his major interaction with volunteers was in the LGBT+ space, but I am unsure.
