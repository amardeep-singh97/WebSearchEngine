If yours has been approved but has not yet been run on the main page, it should either be on this page or will soon be moved here, or already promoted to a Prep area or Queue ahead of an appearance on the main page. If you wish to create a new nomination, please go to the Template talk:Did you know page; there are instructions there in a section similar to this one on how to nominate an article for DYK. Frequently asked questions[edit] Backlogged?[edit] This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until someone promotes it to a preparation area. To alleviate this problem, if the approved page has more than 120 approved hooks, then sets will change twice per day (every 12 hours) instead of once per day (every 24 hours). When the backlog falls below 60 approved nominations set frequency returns to once a day. Where is my hook?[edit] If you can't find the nomination you submitted to the nominations page, and it also isn't on this page, in most cases it means your article has been approved and is either in one of the prep areas, has been promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for other editors[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for full instructions. Note that there are discussions currently under way for changing this process; if any changes are made, these instructions will be revised as necessary. In one window, open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to promote. In another window, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. In the prep set... Paste the hook into the hook area (be sure to not paste in that that) Paste the credit information ({{DYKmake}} and/or {{DYKnom}}) into the credits area. Add an edit summary, e.g., "Promoted [[Jane Fonda]]", preview, and save Back on DYK nomination page... change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage change |passed= to |passed=yes Add an edit summary, e.g., "Promoted original hook to Prep 3", preview, and save How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to the nominations page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from the nominations page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. Nominations[edit] Approved nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on April 17[edit] William Lovelady ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that William Lovelady composed Incantations for guitar and set, on a request by the Duke of Edinburgh, Psalm 104 as a cantata? Source: several Reviewed: The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery Created by NBeale (talk) and Gerda Arendt (talk). Nominated by Gerda Arendt (talk) at 22:50, 24 April 2021 (UTC). A few more hook candidates: Joofjoof (talk) 07:28, 30 April 2021 (UTC) ALT0b:... that William Lovelady set Psalm 104 as a cantata on a request by the Duke of Edinburgh? Source: several ALT1:... that William Lovelady composed Incantations for solo guitar after his song "One More Reggae for the Road" became a hit? Source: several Thank you, but I find it worth saying that The Duke favoured a composer who came from a guitar and incantations background, - striking ALT0b as too one-sided. He was not the typical cantata-psalm-person. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 08:00, 30 April 2021 (UTC) Also: please find a way to mention Psalm 104 in some ALT2 based on ALT1, because I try what I can to mention the psalms, in memory of Yoninah. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 08:02, 30 April 2021 (UTC) Ah, I see. RIP Yoninah (and Prince Philip). Joofjoof (talk) 08:28, 30 April 2021 (UTC) Perhaps ALT0c will flow better: ALT0c: ... that by request of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, William Lovelady composed Incantations for guitar, and set Psalm 104 as a cantata? Kingsif (talk) 12:14, 19 May 2021 (UTC) I'd like to see a citation for that the Duke also requesting incatations. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 12:32, 19 May 2021 (UTC) If it isn't then you're trying to present two unrelated facts in the hook. Just pick one? Do you want to talk about Philip and Psalm 104 or about Lovelady making classical music for guitar? Kingsif (talk) 14:26, 21 May 2021 (UTC) No, I want to describe a wide wange, and the Duke's taste. It's almost quirky that he didn't want the psalm set by some church musician, but a guitar music writer. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 22:11, 23 May 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: That could be easily achieved by just saying it rather than adding a different fact and hoping people put it together? E.g. ALT2: ... that on request of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, William Lovelady, known for his guitar compositions, set Psalm 104 as a cantata? - Kingsif (talk) 20:49, 26 May 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the offer. Can you as easily turn it around so that the Duke doesn't get the hits, but the composer? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 20:53, 26 May 2021 (UTC) I also miss "Incantations", - guitar music is overly general and harmless. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 20:55, 26 May 2021 (UTC) Full review needed. BlueMoonset (talk) 03:59, 26 May 2021 (UTC) Perhaps: ALT2a ... that William Lovelady set Psalm 104 as a cantata on request of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh? Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 07:37, 29 May 2021 (UTC) Sorry, but we need a review, not another version of what was discussed above. Can you please include how unlikely a candidate he was for that request? As the original hook tried. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 08:23, 29 May 2021 (UTC) I'm not really sure what you're asking for with regards to the hook. ALT2a was a revision of ALT2, which per your request was changed in such a way that Lovelady came first. I'm also not sure if Incantations needs to be in the hook given that we don't even have an article on it, but if it's your preference that they be mentioned, then perhaps: ALT2c ... that William Lovelady, known for his guitar compositions Incantations, set Psalm 104 as a cantata on request of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh? ALT2d ... that William Lovelady, known for his Incantations, set Psalm 104 as a cantata on request of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh? Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 08:46, 29 May 2021 (UTC) Can you please add "known for" in the article, with a citation. This person was soooo little known until this funeral, that I'd a hard time to do that. I think Incantations, evoking primitive rituals, at least for me, are nice and quirky in the contects of Christian music, but "known for"? He wrote several, and they became recorded. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 10:30, 29 May 2021 (UTC) ALT0a: ... that William Lovelady composed Incantations for guitar, and, on a request by the Duke of Edinburgh, set Psalm 104 as a cantata? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 10:33, 29 May 2021 (UTC) Kingsif already mentioned above that ALT0 and variants are trying to explain two hook facts and thus didn't flow very well. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 11:30, 30 May 2021 (UTC) It's one fact: the Duke chose someone who was more or less unknown, composing and playing guitar and singing/writing Pop songs, for writing that piece of church music for his birthdays and other functions at Windsor Castle. More elegant wording welcome, but don't don't tell me that's two facts, please. The fact of writing a cantata on a psalm without that contrast is boring, imho. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 11:36, 30 May 2021 (UTC) The fact of writing a cantata on a psalm without that contrast is boring, imho. - the hook isn't for you, though, and how many people reading DYK do you actually expect even know what a cantata is, let alone how it relates to a psalm and how that relates to guitar music. Do you think it will be boring to other people? (And it is two facts because of how you're using active voice to say Lovelady composed guitar music - there are passive ways of establishing the difference, like in my suggestion above - and because they can be read separately and aren't explicitly connected - people with processing disorders or even just those a little slow at comprehension aren't going to see how the parts relate.) It is interesting that a pop guitar composer did some church music, and that Prince Philip requested someone relatively unknown, but putting it all in one hook won't be that easy. Kingsif (talk) 12:17, 30 May 2021 (UTC) Personally I thought the Prince Philip angle was always the more hooky part and the one that would raise the most interest. There's nothing wrong with mentioning Incantations and there are several ways to include that in the hook, but as Kingsif said it's too clunky to try to juggle two different hook facts at the same time, plus the nuance of him being obscure is difficult to mention anyway. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 12:42, 30 May 2021 (UTC) You know that English is not my native tongue, and I hope you know that I tried. I was taught that active voice is better than passive, - do you tell me otherwise? Incantations has an "obscure" / "ancient rites" connatations, - do you tell me that's wrong. We can drop cantata. (But after more than 100 hooks about Bach cantatas, a regular DYK reader will know what a cantata is). People interested will likely have followed the funeral, and may remember that it was sung, and cantata means just "chanted music". I wanted to know who that Mr. Lovelady was, and the hook tries to give an answer. (I didn't watch it, but as Schmücke dich, o liebe Seele was mentioned on my talk I became interested in the two pieces commissioned for joyful celebrations (which a hook says about the other piece, please don't suggest to repeat that), and listened to those. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 15:49, 1 June 2021 (UTC) Whether or not a hook is active or passive doesn't matter too much, what matters is how it flows. While the active voice is usually preferred, some hooks work better passive. It really depends on the circumstances and we don't have strict rules about it. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 01:48, 2 June 2021 (UTC) Full review still needed. Please, no comments about hooks alone until that's done; there's no point if the article doesn't meet the other criteria. Many thanks. BlueMoonset (talk) 21:39, 3 June 2021 (UTC) Article does appear to meet requirements, no close paraphrasing was found, all relevant stuff is cited, and a QPQ was given. The only issue at the moment is the hook wording. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew 01:11, 4 June 2021 (UTC) As there has been no movement in over a week I'm going ahead and approving ALT2c; although I'm aware I proposed it, it is more-or-less a rewording of ALT2, which is itself a rewording of the original hook, and at least one other editor has suggested that the direction that ALT2 and its variations are the best way forward. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 09:23, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Repeating: ALT2c is a fine hook, but please provide a source for that he is known for Incantations. I'd like to avoid ERRORS. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 10:34, 14 June 2021 (UTC) Perhaps: ALT2e ... that William Lovelady, who wrote guitar compositions Incantations, set Psalm 104 as a cantata on request of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh? If you're okay with this, we will need a new reviewer. It's somewhat based on ALT0a but takes into account Kingsif's comments. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:31, 14 June 2021 (UTC) I'm fine with this, striking the original. I hope you forgive me that I'm unable to see the slight difference as relevant. The Duke's centenary would have been good for this, but at least we had the other commissioned piece, chapel pictured that day. - I removed "the" from your proposal, - there are many compositions named Incantation, and there may be others for guitar. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 12:05, 14 June 2021 (UTC) New reviewer needed to check ALT2e. Have struck all hooks with "known" in it, including the previously approved ALT2c. BlueMoonset (talk) 16:25, 24 June 2021 (UTC) Wish I could approve 2e, but something about the grammar bothers me. ALT2f ... that William Lovelady, who wrote Incantations for guitar, set Psalm 104 as a cantata on a request from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh? Rotideypoc41352 (talk · contribs) 16:58, 26 June 2021 (UTC) That sounds good. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:42, 27 June 2021 (UTC) On second thought, while I am willing to approve ALT2f, I'm also wondering if a simpler alternative hook which simply goes Alt2g "... that William Lovelady set Psalm 104 as a cantata on a request from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh?" would also work. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:25, 5 July 2021 (UTC) We'd loose completely what an unlikely candidate the composer was for such a request.

I remember that campaign well. They called him "Jimmy who?" because most people had never heard of him outside of the US State of Georgia. Even Carter joked about himself as "Jimmy who?" He was popular enough to win the nomination for the Democratic candidate, and popular enough to win the election. His popularity as President took some hits because of national issues he had to deal with. But it was never an issue in the 1976 Presidential campaign. ??? Maile (talk) 18:05, 21 May 2021 (UTC) @Maile66: Hi, thanks for your comments. By saying unpopularity, I ment the same that he was not popular or less known throughout the nation except Georgia.

Maile (talk) 10:53, 22 May 2021 (UTC) Comment: "lack of name recognition" or "unfamiliarity to voters" might be the phrase you are looking for that first hook, not "unpopularity". "Unpopularity" would be misunderstood to mean that he had low-approval. SecretName101 (talk) 15:46, 26 May 2021 (UTC) Hi @SecretName101: Thanks for your comments, I have made the changes, but that makes the hook slightly over 200 characters.

Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 15:59, 26 May 2021 (UTC) I'd rephrase ALT2 as "mocked for his unfamiliarity". The missing "his" makes it grammatically incorrect. SecretName101 (talk) 17:25, 26 May 2021 (UTC) @SecretName101: Done But the issue is that the image doesn't relate with the hook of Alt 1.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · Thank you Narutolovehinata5 and Paul2520, I'm back! Sorry, I've been busy and also tweaking a Good Article Nomination. About Obed, he was not fired, he "resigned". According to his descendants he left because he disagreed with his church members about abolition and equality. As was written in two journal articles that I read, because of his outspoken stance his church in Salem received a lot of negative press attention and so his church members did not reappoint him as minister in March of 63. Because he wasn't the minister anymore, the church was able to raise the money they needed to build the church. Then they called him back in September to be the minister. However, the articles noted that his members really wanted him to be quiet about his opinions, but he refused to be quiet. So, in the end he resigned. I think "pressured to resign" is a good way to put it. The minister that replaced him was more moderate and the members liked this better.

Maybe you have your own reasons not for writing harsher hooks, in which case I will OK the ones above. Desertarun (talk) 16:31, 28 May 2021 (UTC) Desertarun, I couldn't think of making this fit within the word limit, but I am open to reviewing and "adopting" any ALT hooks you could craft yourself? Regarding the 16 deaths, they were arguably not part of the Bloody Wednesday. It's a bit weird how the day that is remembered is the one with fewer casualties - maybe it's the case of collective memory, the victims of the 16th were killed, but most of the victims of the 31st survived... anyway, that's why I think the events of the 16th are a 'background' and it's harder to work them into a hook, despite arguably 20 casualties being more significant than 1-3 related to the 31st. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 04:57, 29 May 2021 (UTC) I've added a couple of alts below, I will strike them if you prefer yours above, it is difficult finding the right words.

Desertarun, Regarding the ALTs, thank you for the ideas, but with all due respect I think mine are better. Here's why: ALT2 simply describes the picture, plus it unlikely the readers will care the photo is said to be known to everyone in the small Polish town they likely never heard of. As for ALT3, it perpetuates the incorrect description of this event as something that affected only the Jewish inhabitants of the town (reminder: out of 23 known casualties of summer 1940 in Olkusz, 1 has been identified as Jewish, 22, as far as I can tell, were gentile/ethnic Poles). --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 10:34, 29 May 2021 (UTC) OK, I'm a bit out of my depth with the material, so I've stuck my alts and lets go with your above.

Thanks for the interest in the article, I've updated it accordingly. The sources I've put have proof that the federations had a unique democratic government with roots in Chinese village societies (late Dutch scholars have classified them as "republics"). Theeelman (talk) 22:27, 11 June 2021 (UTC) @Theeelman: The nomination looks great so far, thanks for updating it! Definitely prefer ALT1 hook. The article is long enough and new enough relative to the nomination date. The sources are from Library of Western Belvedere, which says on the website has connection with Fuzhou University and the source page itself has inline citations, so I assume it's reliable. This is your first nomination and first five nominations, QPQ is irrelevant. However, there's still one another problem. DYK rule of thumb is that the article should have at least one minimum inline citation per paragraph excluding the lead. Can you please add citations to uncited paragraphs? Other than that, it's been quite good. Nyanardsan (talk) 23:23, 11 June 2021 (UTC) @MarsandCadmium: Sorry for the ping, are you still continuing the nomination?

I do also have a concern that because this case can be appealed and we are still in that 30 day stay, I would hold off running this until after that date. I'm not too sure on American practice when it comes to reporting cases that have routes of appeal. The C of E God Save the Queen! (talk) 10:25, 9 June 2021 (UTC) I've now added the image and carried over the LA Times ref from the end of the paragraph to cite this inline. I am not aware of the DYK procedure for American court cases either, though I will note that neither hook concerns the actual decision in the case. AllegedlyHuman (talk) 16:19, 9 June 2021 (UTC) I'm also not too keen on using the judge's photo in the DYK context, especially in this case. Hopefully another blurb will run at the same time with a more interesting photo anyways. It crossed my mind to include a side-by-side of an AR-15 and a Swiss army knife, but on second thought, that would give the article a sarcastic tone. Even well after the appeal is filed, I think the blurb as written would still be accurate. It just might not be the latest ruling on the case. For ALT1, consider changing "said" to "wrote".  Minh Nguy??n ? 19:45, 9 June 2021 (UTC) Done Changed "said" to "wrote", and removed the image. On second thought, I agree that the image isn't great for Main Page, for all the reasons mentioned in addition to the fact that it has a pretty low resolution anyway. I like the idea of showing both the gun and the knife but I also agree with your assessment that it may be seen as derisive. I'd really only recommend adding those in if you think there's a good chance people don't know what either "AR-15" or "Swiss Army knife" means, but even then that's what the links are for. While you're here, by the way, fantastic work on cranking out this article. AllegedlyHuman (talk) 20:45, 9 June 2021 (UTC) Good to go then. I think for the gun-knife photo, yes many people might not know what an AR15 is but most do know what a Swiss Army knife is. I'll leave it to the promoter to decide when to promote but i'd recommend it be done after the appeal period has lapsed. The C of E God Save the Queen!

These vessels carried nearly 40,000 Africans to the Americas, and involved a personal investment from Davenport of £127,000, equivalent to £10 million sterling today.

Desertarun (talk) 08:29, 11 June 2021 (UTC) Alt1 ... that William Davenport (1725???1794) was one of the largest and most ubiquitous slaving merchants of his day (pictured, a slave ship)? Source snipped from Alt0 says "Davenport's lengthy involvement in the slave trade, coupled with his substantial personal investment made him one of the largest and most ubiquitous slaving merchants of his day" Alt2 ... that William Davenport was one of the world's most prolific slave traders (pictured, a slave ship)? Source snipped from Alt0 says "Davenport???s lengthy involvement in the slave trade, coupled with his substantial personal investment made him one of the largest and most ubiquitous slaving merchants of his day" Rizzle13, I'm surprised that you think "appalling" is not neutral, but "slave", as a noun, is. There was already one example of "enslaved people" or "enslaved person" in the article, and I've tried to change as many as I could. We should not essentialize the personhood of a victim of kidnapping and enslavement down to a single word. Anyway, there is another problem: the "Abolition" section really is not connected to the subject of the article--and so, the image (which was never simply the image of an enslaved person) isn't connected to the subject either. Nor do I see, given what the article says about the subject, an easy connection between the subject and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Desertarun, maybe there is more in your sources. I do think that the two Alt hooks are great, but I don't think putting that image in there is appropriate. Sorry. Drmies (talk) 00:21, 12 June 2021 (UTC) @Drmies: Hi, thanks for the review.

Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Practice of Psychology: Lillian Comas-Díaz Reviewed: Henriette Spitzeder Comment: Written by Rizzle13. Moved to mainspace by QuakerSquirrel. Full paper of the hook reference is likely behind a paywall. I have access to it & copied the quotation from it. Moved to mainspace by QuakerSquirrel (talk) and Rizzle13 (talk). Nominated by QuakerSquirrel (talk) at 18:41, 14 June 2021 (UTC). Interesting life and work, on good sources, no copyvio obvious. Sorry, the hook doesn't work for me ignorant. Gold medal lets me think of Olympics, and APA told me nothing, - perhaps turn it around, also trying to avoid "after" twice. - In the article, we have a sequence of three sentences, saying "work" five times, - please entertain us better ;) - It is not clear - due to that "recently" (a nono-word) - when the hurricane happened, please clarify. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 13:48, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks Gerda Arendt -- responses below: I have edited the article to lessen the use of the word "work" and its various tenses. With reference to the hurricane, "had been recently" refers to when she moved there. Thus, the hurricane occurred around the age that she was 6. The reliable reference article does not name the hurricane or give the year. Using a rough estimate of age based on when she earned her BA, she would have been 6 around 1953-1956. Hurricane Betsy (known as Hurricane Santa Clara in Puerto Rico) struck the island in 1956. The Wikipedia article about the hurricane states that Yabucoa was particularly hard hit, leaving 12,000 people homeless. Although I think that's a pretty good guess for which hurricane it was, we really can't say for sure that's it, nor do we know her birthdate so I can't say for sure when she was 6. "Had been recently" places the hurricane slightly before she arrived at age 6. Let me know if you have a wording change suggestion. The award is called the Gold Medal Award. If it makes people think of the Olympics & they see that it's the American Psychological Association (I dropped the acronym), I think that may pique their interest to learn more.

(pictured, a slave ship) Created by Desertarun (talk). Self-nominated at 20:45, 16 June 2021 (UTC). - Unless Leyland was involved in some highly unusual practices, use of the word enslaved in the hook and the article is erroneous. Enslaved means to make a slave and it is much more likely these people were already slaves that Leyland purchased. I can't find a single source that says he enslaved anyone, only that he transported slaves. For the same reasons, using 'kidnapping' is also possibly incorrect. --Ykraps (talk) 07:08, 6 July 2021 (UTC) I take your point. The slavers had African agents who they would write to and place orders for enslaved people, so he most certainly did enslave people. What proportion of those 22,365 people that he personally ordered enslaved would be impossible to separate from those he bought at other times, so I will reword the article and offer Alts here. Desertarun (talk) 07:51, 6 July 2021 (UTC) @Desertarun: I would argue that even in those cases, use of the verb enslaved is inaccurate. However, I see no reason to dwell on that. Perhaps changing the hook to "...transported 22,365 slaves...", would be acceptable? --Ykraps (talk) 06:29, 7 July 2021 (UTC) Article doesn't seem to be completely ineligible, so using less alarming icon to indicate its current status.

Created by Patar knight (talk). Nominated by NorthernFalcon (talk) at 18:58, 20 June 2021 (UTC). Article satisfies date and length criteria. There may be referencing quirks in the article, particularly with the following: "On June 24, 2019, Jamal was appointed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on the advice of Justin Trudeau to replace Justice Gladys Pardu, who became a supernumerary judge." - the ref supports the claim about "appointed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario", but not the remainder of the text in that sentence "He has served stints as a director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Advocates' Society, and the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History." is not supported by the associated citation; this should be cited to ref 6 (Ottawa appoints one judge in Ontario, promotes another) instead Per the Wikipedia:Did you know/Supplementary guidelines#Other supplementary rules for the article point D2, the paragraph "While Jamal's appointment is, constitutionally..." should have a citation. Hook is short enough and cited in text. This is nominator's NorthernFalcon first submission to DYK, so QPQ not required (article creator Patar knight has 6 DYKs). I prefer the original hook with the Canadian term. Once the two ref quirks are rectified, this article can be promoted.

The second has not been addressed. The ref attached to the sentence "He has served stints as a director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association..." does not support the claim made; I think it should be cited to ref 6, not ref 3. I've made the change myself (see this diff), as it is a trivial change. Please ensure this is correct; once this is done, the article will be promoted.

There's a maintenance tag that needs to be addressed. There's (non-straightforward) disambiguation required. The big issue that I have is the super-heavy reliance on direct quotes. Doing prose size the old fashioned way (in MS Word) and comparing the article "as is" and a version with all the direct quotes stripped, they make up a whopping 28%. There aren't hard and fast rules on this, but Wikipedia:QUOTEFARM recommends that "quotations should not dominate the article". In my view, that threshold has been crossed and the article should be reworked to get the proportion and number of direct quotes down. Beyond that, the article is new, long enough, and free of POV. Earwig expresses unhappiness ("Violation Possible: 45.4% similarity") but it's all the direct quotes plus the rather long book title. Suitably referenced. Regarding ALT0, the four sources are all good; note I have not checked ALT1 or ALT2. So, there's a bit of work to do. AFAICS, the nominator has two previous DYks so a QPQ is not required. Schwede66 09:23, 21 June 2021 (UTC) I've added section headings (although I don't feel they're necessary in a relatively short article), and I've pared down the quotations. I'm reluctant to paraphrase the author too much, as I don't wish to inadvertently distort her message. I'm going to have to do some more research to figure out the correct disambiguation for real space. Let me know what you think. pburka (talk) 18:11, 21 June 2021 (UTC) The disambiguation has been dealt with, now, too. pburka (talk) 21:57, 21 June 2021 (UTC) ALT0 is good to go.

Hi Alansplodge, review follows: article creatdd 19 June; article is well written and cited inline throughout to reliable sources; I didn't spot any issues with overly close paraphrasing from a spot check of the sources; hooks are interesting (ALT0 is especially so), mentioned in the article and check out to sources cited; a QPQ has been completed. My only comment is that Pevsner does not mention the height of the font cover which is described as "exceptionally tall" in the article. I won't hold up the nomination for it and the cover certainly looks exceptionally tall from the photo, but probably should be sourced - Dumelow (talk) 07:01, 28 June 2021 (UTC) Tatjana Gamerith ( Review or comment Article history ) Tatjana Gamerith in 2013 ... that the artist Tatjana Gamerith's (pictured) future husband, then 20, told her that he did not care that she was 20 older than him, and that they had been married for over 60 years?

Interesting rich long life, on good sources, and I can read the German ones, no copyvio. - Sigh, I don't like the hook, don't like it being only focused on her being twice as old as her husband when they met, without any achievements, also I find the sequence of possessive, pictured, clause ... needlessly confusing, and further the tense of the last bit is wrong because it suggests the 60 years of happy marriage had already happened when he said that. In an article about her, she should be quoted ;) - Summary: if you want to stick to that fact alone, say that although she was twice as old as her future husband, they went on to be married for 60 years. But I'd prefer something different, such as their prize together. The pic is licensed and a good illustration, but is there a year to add to the caption? - In the article: it reads as if the prize was for her achievements, not their. I like your extra service of trying to translate the German refs, but the double meaning of "einfach zu leben" is missing. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 16:22, 21 June 2021 (UTC) ALT1: ... that the artist Tatjana Gamerith (pictured) and her husband, who was 20 years younger than her, devoted their 60 years of married life towards uniting art and nature?

Ashleyyoursmile! 11:34, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Thank you, and I dropped the 's. Is "unite art and nature" I am the only one not to understand. Why "devoted"? Can I say I devote a year towards music? (learning English, you see?) --Gerda Arendt (talk) 11:50, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Also, the article doesn't mention that devotion over the full length of their marriage. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 11:52, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Just a drive-by comment: Why not mention the prize in the hook, given that it was for their joint achievement? Something like "together with her husband who was 20 years younger was awarded a prize for their joint work"? Can't think of a precise hook wording atm, but I think that would preserve the uniqueness of their relationship and also point to her/their achievements (I would drop the 60 years of marriage). --LordPeterII (talk) 16:51, 25 June 2021 (UTC) ALT2: ... that the artist Tatjana Gamerith (pictured) together with her husband who was 20 years younger was awarded a prize for their joint work to combine art and nature?

Ashleyyoursmile! 07:44, 26 June 2021 (UTC) It's good, but I miss the 60 years, - perhaps more important than he 20 years younger, or can we have both? - We could drop "artist" which is said later. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:51, 26 June 2021 (UTC) ALT2a: ... that Tatjana Gamerith (pictured) and her husband who was 20 years younger had been married for over 60 years and were awarded a prize for their joint work to combine art and nature?

Ashleyyoursmile! 12:52, 27 June 2021 (UTC) I'm afraid I'm not loving the 20-years-younger part at all. Would we ever mention the age disparity if it were the other way around? ???valereee (talk) 16:48, 6 July 2021 (UTC) I don't know why not. My grandfather was almost as much older than my grandmother, and the bride's mother was against the marriage, afraid her daughter would be a widow for a long time. They were married for more than 60 years as well. In that context, I think it's ok. It wouldn't be as the only thing said about the two. If you want to make it more neutral, you could say one partner was that much younger without a hint who, but I'd think it's a bit needlessly "fair". --Gerda Arendt (talk) 17:30, 6 July 2021 (UTC) Because if it were a man 20 years older than his wife we likely wouldn't even be mentioning it in either of their articles, and certainly wouldn't find it one of the more interesting or important things about him for using in his DYK hook. See Donald Trump (6000+ editors) and Melania Trump (1000+). No mention, in very very long articles. ???valereee (talk) 22:11, 9 July 2021 (UTC) I don't think you understood what I meant, - sorry about being unclear. Without knowing who is the older one: a difference that high just makes it less likely that the marriage lasts so long. Is that clearer? In numbers: if 2 people get married, both 20, they can be married for 60 years with both being only 80. If one of them is already 40 at the time - whoever - that one must reach 100 to be married for 60 year. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 22:22, 9 July 2021 (UTC) Show me a hook where we're calling out the fact the man was 20 years older than the woman as one of the more interesting or important things to know about him, and we can talk. I'm sorry, Gerda, I think your story about your grandparents is quite charming, and if that came across the tandem as a hook, I'd not object, but in general comments about the wife being 20 years older just feels sexist to me. We literally don't even (on a brief skim) seem to mention that fact in the articles for Donald and Melania Trump, that's how irrelevant it is when the man is older. But when the woman is older it's somehow interesting enough to be included in a 200-character description of the most interesting/surprising/important thing about this person? It might be interesting that she was married for 60 years even though she didn't marry until she was 40, but how does the age difference figure in that? It would actually be more surprising in the other direction: that someone was married for 60 years even though their spouse was 20 years older. ???valereee (talk) 23:00, 9 July 2021 (UTC) I think we are not talking about the same thing, but this weekend, I have no time. I hope the creator will manage a hook to please you. (... dropping the age difference altogether, or not saying who was older ...). --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:43, 10 July 2021 (UTC) No worries, and I'd be fine with a hook that said "she and her husband, despite an age difference of 20 years, were married for 60" or something. ???valereee (talk) 11:10, 10 July 2021 (UTC) Valereee, Gerda Arendt my apologies for the late response.

The hooks are all short enough, and appear in the article with off-line sources which are accepted in good faith. However I don't think that all three are interesting. To me, ALT2 is the best and I'll be striking out the rest. Before this can go ahead, I think the following (small) issues should be fixed: 1) in the 'Robinsonville apparition' section, there is a statement ("The Peshtigo fire was God???s fire and brimstone sent down to punish a sinful city") with no inline citation. Given the high standard of sourcing in this article, could this be rectified? 2) The article has many images, which is good, but some of them create a MOS:SANDWICH where text is squashed between images. It would be great if this could be cleaned up. 3) At the moment, the article doesn't reflect everything said in the ALT2. The text doesn't say that he was punished for being away for too long.

I'm going to be very critical on NPOV: I don't like "One colleague described Cleaver's personality as ambitious and pragmatic" because it's the sort of thing you say in a job interview or profile and often not accurate/the most relevant descriptor (and this is Cleaver talking about the colleague talking about her!). I'm similarly not a fan of "brings a technological mindset to her work" (the source says something more concrete about internet use being an overlooked medium in 2008???say that in the appropriate paragraph, or say nothing). But "her personal politics are liberal" is really important to mention so it's good that that's there (I was wondering this through my whole reading of "Career"). I notice that we don't say what she was concretely doing in her political volunteering in 2000???2008. Working for the Democrats? Something non-partisan about registering electors? If the source says, it's probably necessary to mention. ??? Bilorv (talk) 12:08, 6 July 2021 (UTC) Thanks for the review, Bilorv. For her personality, I'll see if I can find something more removed from her to quote. She seems very type-A, which seems relevant, but I understand the concern. For the technological mindset, the paragraph from which I drew that was this: ???One of Debra's real strengths in this space is that she didn't come up through campaigns and that sort of professional campaign world, frankly, in the way that I did before I went back to being a professor,??? says Chris Mann ???94, an assistant professor of political science at Skidmore College who became a consultant and advisor to Cleaver???s ventures after the two Pomona College alumni were introduced through professional circles. ???She brings this very Silicon Valley, very entrepreneurial mindset to thinking about how to do things.???

Bilorv (talk) 16:18, 6 July 2021 (UTC) I commented out the first sentence since I'm not really invested enough in this to be willing to go through all the sources again to try to find something better. I slightly rephrased the other sentence, but I don't really see any issues with it; it reflects what the source says as closely as is possible without plagiarizing. Do you have any further concerns? {{u|Sdkb}}???talk 02:58, 7 July 2021 (UTC) I'm still not comfortable with the "entrepreneurial mindset" sentence. Perhaps I wasn't clear: the problem isn't the phrasing, but that the very "fact" is POV. Some colleague was asked to say something flattering about Cleaver for a profile written by her uni to portray her positively (because it looks good for them to have successful alumni), so the claim is inherently puffery. If it's an important fact then we convey the information by concretely describing something she did where someone with a different approach may have done something different (e.g. the 2008 website or 2016 texts). Or, you can remove it entirely if you want. ??? Bilorv (talk) 12:16, 7 July 2021 (UTC) Thanks for elaborating.

Right image for ALT1 and ALT2. 5x expanded by Bloom6132 (talk). Self-nominated at 00:15, 23 June 2021 (UTC). It looks like the article barely misses being a fivefold expansion, but the prose portion is adequately long. Was the person who turned the salt heaps into igloos a designer or an official? Sources appear to disagree on this. I can't check all sources but I didn't notice any copyvio or plagiarism or any non-neutral content. I question whether we should use the newspaper sources here, though. I think ALT1 is more interesting but perhaps an even better hook could be made by stating that someone mistakenly turned the salt heaps into igloos?

I'm unsure if that's the case for the badge on the right (could be faithful reproduction of the design at the time). How's this for another hook: ALT2:... that the salt mounds on the former badge of the Turks and Caicos Islands (pictured) were mistakenly turned into igloos? Should I specify that doors were added? ???Bloom6132 (talk) 10:27, 23 June 2021 (UTC) I don't think you need to specify doors. The reason why I am wondering about the images is because if there is a standardized depiction it is probably a non-free image which we can't put on the main page. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk) 10:45, 23 June 2021 (UTC) @Jo-Jo Eumerus: Would a standardized depiction be covered by expired Crown copyright (as in Template:PD-UKGov)?

I've struck Alt1 because it would be confusing to a wider audience and it isn't supported properly by the refs. Alt2 is making the assertion that he could make the ball buzz, but in the article it appears to be discussing a single occurrence of buzzing. For this alt to be considered you'd need to address this in the article. Desertarun (talk) 08:50, 30 June 2021 (UTC) Thanks for the review. I think the article is clear, however, that Laker would frequently produce a sound as he spun the ball.

Overall: The article has been awarded GA status within 7 days from its appearance, and is long enough (though pretty short for GA standards). The article is also reasonably sourced and is neutral. No plagiarism detected, though a few sources are in Lithuanian, where I assume good faith on behalf of the nominator. The original hook is bland, but ALT1 is fine for me. The editor is QPQ-exempt for now. I'd say alright for the version so far as the DYK nomination goes, so in that context, I am fine with the hook. However, I have serious doubts about the GA status in this case. Not that I want to nominate it for its revocation right now or that I won't let it go for DYK, but there are several issues which I see as incompatible with GA and should be corrected ASAP. First, the article needs proofreading badly, which I'll do. Bear in mind, though, that I know Russian but not Lithuanian, so if my corrections/best guesses in any way distort what you wanted to say in Lithuanian, let me know. Second, the article in Russian is more expansive than the English version, and I suspect that many more sources can be found in Russian, and probably in Google Scholar/Google Books. This, again, needs a Russian-speaking editor. Even as the "broad coverage" does not necessitate coverage of all aspects of the problem, it should nevertheless be broad, which I don't believe is the case here. I will be of some help there, but it would be best if some Russian-speaking Wikipedian from LT led the effort. I think more hooks could be retrieved from this research, which will probably attract more users to the article.

First hook is interesting, but I have a little doubt - was the decision the actual trigger, or merely a pretext to attack a Protestant? No evidence of copyvio or plagiarism as far as I can see. QPQ is OKish. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk) 08:12, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Jo-Jo Eumerus I changed the prose for ref 3 so that it more closely matches what the source says. For ALT0: the judging was probably the pretext to attack Corrigan because he was Protestant and Corrigan tried to start fights (both verbal and physical) with the Catholic population. Happy to strike or reword it. Z1720 (talk) 15:37, 4 July 2021 (UTC) The "probably" is a bit of a problem, I think. It sounds like WP:OR if you need to qualify your statements like that. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk) 08:45, 5 July 2021 (UTC) The Biographi source goes into lots of detail about how Corrigan was strongly disliked by the Irish-Catholic community of his town. The sources also states that the attack was influenced by their opinion on Corrigan; it says "His neighbours, therefore, were waiting for the chance to pick a fight with him, and the opportunity came at an agricultural fair on 17 Oct. 1855." So he was attacked because of his bad behaviour towards the community, and the judging of the fair was the trigger. Is there anything that needs to be clarified in either the article or this hook?

I've put the original (2011) article creator into the credits; is this a done thing? Could we please run this on 23 July, when rowing is supposed to start in Tokyo and the heats for women's single scull are the second event on the schedule? (still not convinced that the Olympic Games will go ahead but we are getting closer and it's still not cancelled...) The heats will be between 8:30 h and 12:10 h Japan Standard Time (JST; UTC+09:00). Very conveniently, I see that Tokyo is in the local update times table. Note that I've also nominated Hannah Osborne in double scull with the same request. If we do run this on 23 July, the original hook is the more relevant one as it refers to an event that is starting on that day. 5x expanded by Schwede66 (talk) and Inwind (talk).

Overall: I read the above conversation, and also read the source regarding if she "qualified" for the Olympics. The source says she qualified, using that specific word. Other sources say that she was invited by the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games Tripartite Commission Invitation Places determined that she was suitable to participate in the games, based on her performance at previous sporting events. Therefore, I think using the word "qualify" is acceptable because her invitation to participate was due to her performance at other sporting events, allowing her to meet the Tripartite Commission's qualifications to receive an invitation. As for the hooks, I think ALT1 is boring, and I have some concerns about ALT0. I have proposed an ALT below: ALT2: ... that Sri Lankan shooter Tehani Egodawela was the third person from her country to qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics?

That's how I'd read the hook. - Minor questions for the article: I am so trained to J. S. Bach - or that Wikipedia style trumps published titles - that W.E.B. strikes me as bold. In the list of characters, it seems simpler to first name the parents, then the daughter. At that point we know already that she is the protagonist.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 16:07, 23 June 2021 (UTC) User:Narutolovehinata5, tweak made. Gerda Arendt, I did the characters (roughly) by order of importance. It's not a family tree. I'm not sure what you mean with skin color, unless it's that I capitalize Black and do white in lower case, along with the NYT, the AP, and others. Does that help? Yes, 27 July, that gives us plenty of time, no? Thanks! Drmies (talk) 19:48, 23 June 2021 (UTC) Drmies, thank you for the trimming, Drmies. (I sometimes think that the length of the article name should be taken into account, - this is extra-long, leaving little room to say something.) The question is open if only the love songs illustrate the lives, not the whole book. Same question in the lead, where it says the love songs "provide insight into and detail ...". - Not the whole book? Also open if you intend to move to W. E. B., or risk that it will come up at ERRORS on the day appearing? In the Characters, we have 6 people, light-skinned and "White Man" mentioned for some, and nothing for some others. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 20:42, 23 June 2021 (UTC) Gerda Arendt, I indicated color as the secondary sources did; for some characters it matters, apparently, and for others less so. The "White Man" bit is a direct quote. From the reviews it appears that the poems comment on the past, not the present--but obviously I didn't get an advance copy of the book, so I can't answer that and stuck to what the sources said. As for the hook, the article title doesn't count toward the 200 characters. I'm not moving the title--we have a number of articles for organizations and things named for Du Bois that don't have the spaces, and the book certainly doesn't have it. I hope that this will not be a problem for the DYK watchers, or that someone wants to fight over it.
